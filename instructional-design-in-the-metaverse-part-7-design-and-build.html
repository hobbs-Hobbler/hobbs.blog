<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">At this point, we have all of the building blocks ready to begin a design. We know what works from 2D learning and what to try with 3D learning. Beginning the steps to launch an XR experience can feel more like a User Experience (UX) project than an instructional design project, however. UX similarly uses storyboards, journey mapping, and personas which can be very helpful in designing emotion into the experience. Prototype versions can be ready for a few users to sample and give feedback. Overall, ID projects in the metaverse feel different because the designing and building phases <i>blend together</i> with test layouts requiring adjustment.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Even at the final project launch, instructional designers (IDs) should observe how the learners are experiencing the design. IDs should be at the forefront with the learners, constantly evaluating what is working and what is not. It can be very helpful for IDs to observe what learners try first or how they explore the experience. In this way, design with this media is less of a one-way instance and more of an ongoing process. Remember <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PXRJEAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=UpbIsA4SJU&amp;dq=learning%20experience%20design%20Clark&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. Clark's</a> 'always beginning, never ending' design advice? The following three sections represent lessons already learned in ID for XR designs.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">1 Focus on Purpose</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Determining purpose at the earliest stage is critical because the purpose guides many of the upcoming ID decisions. Traditional ID projects begin with these questions that ask about the main learning objective or goal.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">However, because the metaverse is an experience for the learners, it can be thought of as a place and time; it is like a field trip. </p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Here is an example: An art history instructor wants to recreate a visit to the Sistine Chapel. Rather than first creating an XR building or finding an XR recreated chapel, the ID can determine what is the most important experience for the learner. It could be:</p>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Appreciating Michelangelo’s artistic style</p>
</li>
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Imagining how the artist would have painted in the space</p>
</li>
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Discussing the role of sponsors for art</p>
</li>
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Viewing the artwork like real life (looking up)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Each of those different purposes could generate a different learning design.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Let’s say the instructor wants to emphasize<strong> viewing the artwork within the chapel, on the curved ceiling and the soaring upper walls and how this viewing angle intersects with perspective</strong>. Noting prior experiences, learners might have only seen this art <i>somewhat</i> straight-on from photographs. </p>

</a></div>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In XR, designers could use either or both. The learners might be able to first view the artwork from the floor and then <strong>fly</strong> and compare looking at the art from mid-air. In this way, the learners will have comparative viewing from different angles…something that the real life Chapel can not easily provide. This satisfies the instructor's request to focus on the viewing experience by providing a standard replication and then a different angle as comparison. </p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">By thinking about the learner’s experience, the designer can start to list which aspects of the real world need to be replicated (e.g., gravity, enclosed space) and which aspects will not be from reality (e.g. flying on demand). In summary, <strong>this adage fits: begin with the end in mind.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For XR designs, ask “what is the feeling that you want your learner to have?” That might come as a surprise– elevating feeling as a primary design priority. The next section will address why the feel of an XR design is more important than its content.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Emotional coinage works in XR storytelling because emotion transcends language;</strong> it does not need a text pop-up or an AI translator.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">When an emotion can be relayed in some sort of visual or sound media, the designer can worry less about language translation or exactness in the metaverse. XR works naturally in this realm. Combining emotion with narrative plot creates designs where the learner is truly at the center because the learner becomes the lead character in the story. They are pulled along the learning journey because their character (their avatar) is experiencing the story. </p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In planning a design, IDs can ask the instructor what the main emotion is that they want their learners to feel within the space (curiosity, happiness, fear, proficiency, etc.).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The emotions can, of course, change as the story changes. In prototypes, IDs should ask learners what feelings they have in the XR space. Does the feeling match the purpose/goal? If not, the design needs to be changed to foster the emotion that is intended.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3 Real World Correlation</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">After the purpose is established and the central emotions are noted for a learning experience, the ID can determine how much of a real world correlation there is to the XR experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For instance, when coming up against a design challenge in XR, IDs should ask, “How is this done in the real world?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The answer might be that the learner does a behavior (e.g. takes notes or alters a piece of equipment) or retrieves more information (e.g. looks at a reference source). With some consideration, the real world solution can be strategized together with the Multimedia Principles and created in XR. For example, if learners are struggling to remember a series of steps, do they need a nearby poster as a visual aid? If learners are getting something wrong with timing, do they need a stopwatch or clock? In XR, posters and clocks do not need to necessarily <i>hang on walls</i>. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi22vDEFrTPHixDsS5V2xQlYId8EbhlZ5hbNTeroaxQCL2ACVHs0MZgniZ4Go9csTPnnCda-aSF24a0E-W9vt0Gxij68JM2iN_JTnt9x8_kQcyw2iFGlxGZewbCH9IL0rvPbq4Cy0ZvzmRTmjzTzzErj8Rt7WolpjC5_3uc2E5BVgLvJAf4bak-L-Lius4/w400-h206/Screenshot%202023-10-17%20124529.png" alt="Timer appears in the upper left corner, but it could be placed anywhere, or appear on demand." width="400" height="206" border="0" data-original-height="749" data-original-width="1454" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Capture from a rabbit counting experience. The timer appears in the upper left corner indicating 33 seconds left. Timers and clocks can be placed anywhere in XR. </figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Combining what we already know from the Multimedia Principles will maximize the opportunity to learn <strong>by placing the relevant information when and where the learner will need it.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Starting with real world correlations is the healthy first step, but next, the IDs should consider <strong>what affordances</strong> XR can further provide. For example, do the learners need to fly or go inside an object? XR easily provides the ability to go through what would be solid objects like walls. Referring to a prior example, if a learner needs access to a clock, can a floating one be put into the learner's field of view, but not necessarily on a wall or wrist? By imagining the experience in pieces or segments, an ID can deconstruct what is necessary to drive the experience along and then rebuild those segments with the added possibilities of 3D design.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Here is another example: an experience is replicating a spacewalk in outer space. The learning objective is to have the learner follow the correct procedure despite stressful conditions. The learner needs to put on a space suit following the correct procedure and check it for safety before leaving the spaceship. The emotional tone is to be calm and methodical even if the situation is urgent. What is the real world correlation to this experience? It might be donning protective equipment at a cold weather research station. This is a cognitively correlated event; the thought process is very similar. Thus, we can use this real world event to drive the design of the XR event. Items need to be put on in a certain order and checked for safety before going outside. </p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The XR design might want to include an alarm sound or flashing light to create urgency. Some sort of ‘buddy check’ system might stand by so that after the learner puts on the equipment, it is checked by another entity. Including alarms and safety checks are correlations to real world elements that can be built into the experience<i>.</i> The details of surrounding walls and floors or what is happening outside the spaceship do not influence this learning event. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayer</a> (2020) refers to these as <strong>seductive details</strong> – interesting, but they detract from the learning. Therefore, those details can be minimized in the surrounding design.</p>
