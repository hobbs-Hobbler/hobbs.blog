Yes, this is important. That person can be sad, happy, angry, in denial, relieved, or fearful. That person gets to <strong class=\"mg gx\">emote out</strong> (dump out) any emotion they want for as long as they want.</p>\n<p id=\"1c4e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The second part is <strong class=\"mg gx\">care in</strong>. This means that in successive societal circles around the bereaved, each circle does what one can to pour care <em class=\"ny\">in</em> towards the bereaved. Each circle has a zone of control where they can execute their powers.</p>\n<p id=\"7288\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For example, immediately around the bereaved is likely family (spouse, children, siblings). Their <strong class=\"mg gx\">care in</strong> duties will often be the most personal and direct but also the most hidden and quiet. They may help pick out clothing for the body. They can stay with the bereaved until a few days have passed, making sure that the bereaved can do things like eat, drink, and sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"e66e\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The next outer circle might contain the children’s bosses at their place of employment, who care in by granting as much bereavement leave as possible. Churches often are in this circle too and they can arrange meal delivery or communicate prayer requests. Circles further out are societal structures of updating paperwork or processing a death certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"e668\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">What should NOT happen is mixing the emoting out and caring in.</p>\n<p id=\"135a\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So <strong class=\"mg gx\">DO NOT EMOTE IN.</strong></p>\n<p id=\"12b6\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Examples of emoting in include cruel statements like: “You should be glad he is with our Lord” or “It is blessing that you don’t have to worry about his constant care anymore.” That is pouring an emotion in. No. Never do that. You have no right. <strong class=\"mg gx\">NO EMOTION IN </strong>towards the center. No level can <em>emote in</em> to a level that is closer to the center.</p>\n<p id=\"d978\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Also, you can’t expect the bereaved to send care out. This is not the time to ask them to make your favorite cake. It’s just not right.</p>\n<p id=\"038d\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Now, each person gets to play a role in grieving. Just because a spouse is the center of her circle over the death of her husband doesn’t mean that each child will also be the center of their own circles over the death of their father. So the circles do overlap. The point is to recognize who is closer the rawness of death and cede the emotional center to them <em class=\"ny\">at that moment</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"4f27\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I offer this advice as someone for whom death has been a companion. I’ve lost many treasured family members over the past 15 years and learned that grief is not like a wave that you stand up from, recover, brush yourself off, and look ahead. <em><strong>You don’t get over it. </strong></em>You get changed by it. Grief is a like yeast to bread; it works it's way into every part of the loaf. Grief changes you and makes you see perspective.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"nv nw nx\">\n<p id=\"0433\" class=\"me mf ny mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk msg msg--highlight \" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Grief makes you love deeper, laugh more, and cry harder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"03a0\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">From my experience, I send you hope. Life changes. Sweetness arrives again in birdsong or a child’s laughter. Pain subsides like the tide pulling away. You will begin to fear death less when you realize that we are all together in this journey.</p>\n<p id=\"d2b9\" class=\"pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Peace to you.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"nv nw nx\">\n<p id=\"a692\" class=\"me mf ny mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Psalms 23:4<br>Even though I walk<br>through the darkest valley,<br>I will fear no evil,<br>for you are with me;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure class=\"nf ng nh ni nj nk nc nd paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"nl nm fl nn bh no\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">\n<div class=\"nc nd oa\"><figure class=\"bh ll np c\"><source srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" type=\"image/webp\"><source data-testid=\"og\" srcset=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd 1400w\" sizes=\"(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"><img  role=\"presentation\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:861/0*GWR-UQNpJEqsvIJd\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></picture></div>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"nq ff nr nc nd ns nt bf b bg ab du\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Photo by <a class=\"ag nu\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/@lili_popper?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lili Popper</a> on <a class=\"ag nu\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr>\n<p><br>This post was originally published on Medium.com on April 6, 2020.
