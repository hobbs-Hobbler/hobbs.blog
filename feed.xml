                <p>With the results of the United States Presidential Election in November 2024, there was a tectonic shift in the thinking of individuals that do want to speak truth to power, but also do not want to be unwise in the act. My blog is primarily about speaking the truth about XR for learning around and despite some very powerful companies and a few personal enemies.<br><br>I'm old enough that the lessons of World War II are not lost on me.¬† The time period between November 2024 and this blog going live in June/July 2025 has caused many to harken of 1920s Germany. Indeed, several new phrases have been circulating in my head.<br><br><a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/twenty-lessons-read-by-john-lithgow" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Do not obey in advance</a> is one.<br><br>But another idea is <strong>to not give up my data</strong>, even if I'm utilizing my free speech rights as a US citizen. The idea that one would not be caught up in being arrested or worst <em>if</em> one is doing nothing wrong...is behind us. The monster eats and it eats anyone it can get.</p>

<p><br>That idea lead me to the lovely <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Opt Out Project blog</a>.<br><br>Even though I had no direct reason for jumping ship from blogger/blogspot...how MUCH big tech is scraping personal accounts for data now just friggin scares me.¬† I left Twitter/X because of their new policy so take anything anyone posts as food for their AI.¬† I create and share my creations. I was like...uh, no, you are not free to take my stuff.¬† So I left, deleting everything in my wake.</p>

It took me 4 months to get this blog up and running.¬† To the best of my ability, here is what it does.<br><br>1. <strong>I don't care about number counting reads</strong>. Read counts stoke vanity. I've also never activated replies to my posts. If you want to respond, do so on your own blog, thankyouverymuch. üßê I try very hard to not count nor look at the numbers of anything I create.¬† It's not. about. the. numbers. üö´üî¢<br><br>2. This blog is hosted on Github Pages, which is at this time a Microsoft product. <strong>I encourage you to visit using a VPN</strong> because they are probably tracking IPs, but I do not receive the information. <strong>I do not have ANY analytics</strong> that I have activated on this blog.¬†¬†<br><br>3. I'm using Publii and since I only post blog posts and nothing else (no stores, no forms, no mailing lists...I guess the kids call this static HTML now) <strong>I do not plan on adding ANY plugins</strong>. I'm using a basic theme available from Publii.¬† I'll let you know here and in the cookie banner if that changes in the future.<br><br>4. I'm going to attempt to set up the cookie banner to be meaningless for collecting anything and to strongly encourage you to Reject cookies. Let's hope I figure that out.</p>
<p>Oh and one more thing, <strong>I do not monetize anything here</strong>. Nothing.¬† By willingly turning my back on all forms of monetization, I'm never working for someone else that will show up as bias in my writing.<br><br>As Opt Out Project writes: <strong>No trackers. No fingerprints. No data collection.</strong><br><br>Let us all live long and prosper.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">So what are the characteristics that predict success for an educational experience? Read on.</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading">Characteristics of Success</h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">By the time IDs are often introduced to learning projects, the decision to incorporate XR technologies might already be made. Yet, IDs might be tasked with evaluating choices for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FcHXvL2SmWqNwnLpmc-0Ti2N6tQotVseBYWSjL39P2w/edit#heading=h.nnsa5urx8jnn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">off-the-shelf XR experiences</a> or do-it-yourself (DIY) projects. Both choices have possibilities and limits and this part will point out what characteristics predict that an XR solution should work for a given implementation.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">IDs should complete a thorough market analysis for off-the-shelf experiences. However, learning standards and ratings have not moved from early research to implementation (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lana-Dreimane/publication/338676708_Virtual_Reality_Learning_Experience_Evaluation_Tool_for_Instructional_Designers_and_Educators/links/613f19b8e4419c5e6ec9d8eb/Virtual-Reality-Learning-Experience-Evaluation-Tool-for-Instructional-Designers-and-Educators.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreimane</a>, 2020). Thus, the experiences vary in quality with some being quite poor.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDCG3cbqrp-zzn2winwvdqhQr4P1fkEce8B124r1SCOSMeEzoZ4On83LNyERpvlTpu1u6tQfhRQMj4DqmDK5YEptKA-Q_tTQwcXk2NR0bDMybGKFBisZh7fLlYfSBw-F2qvzHk2nJ1JqqFwF8jYQjpZ7ypNpSUqkKvUrCVqmtI_7YEuZuunJptYbTwFYI/w320-h191/Immune%20U%20Side%20Quest.png" alt="Screen capture inside an unnamed game on immunology." width="320" height="191" border="0" data-original-height="917" data-original-width="1535" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Yeah, I'm looking at¬† you unnamed game on immunology.</figcaption></figure>
<div>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">On the other hand, <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-taught-one-earths-first-courses-oculus-quest-2-heather-dodds" rel="noopener noreferrer">XR experiences not tagged as educational can be successfully used for learning</a> with careful implementation.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In a DIY project, IDs could be asked to learn 3D programming, such as Unity or Unreal. Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to be used for 3D development and this could assist IDs. If IDs do engage primarily in programming and building assets, there is a risk that they will take their eyes off the goal of representing the learner. An ID should be constantly asking the question,‚Äúwhat is the learner experiencing?‚Äù and making sure that all decisions align to the planned purpose.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In general, the research up to this point indicates these three characteristics predict a successful XR educational experience:</p>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>it saves or manipulates time</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>it saves money</strong></p>
</li>
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>it reduces danger </strong>(<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://sts.stanford.edu/publications/experience-demand-what-virtual-reality-how-it-works-and-what-it-can-do" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bailenson</a>, 2018; <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58948-6_4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ziker, Truman, &amp; Dodds,</a> 2021).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">While having one of these characteristics is good for continuing development, having two or all three characteristics can lead to very successful full implementation. For example, an XR experience for wind turbine maintenance training would currently save time, money, and danger.</p>

<h2 class="article-editor-content__paragraph" style="text-align: left;"><strong>It Saves or Manipulates Time</strong></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">XR experiences can manipulate time for instruction. For instance, an experience could involve time travel, speeding up, slowing down, or pausing time.¬†</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEq_nprM1rsAOpZca3h7CxrfEkxum03r_Xf-tGuLLRqaqFw71BGIwlNXDrhr14RQI8YQSy1mZ8djWGx-Ld_4DqOiwXv5UE3V4g0UZMLSWWSVOWMjNENqq389JGaHT6RDtTUh8UkZiqKWHgosUJj7r5xjOFpTeKjfpqBkNh5Ns9RgikKwbQwVytS6H6Q94/w640-h320/River%20City.png" width="640" height="320" border="0" data-original-height="350" data-original-width="700" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Credit: River City Project, Harvard, Chris Dede: <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://muve.gse.harvard.edu/screenshots" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://muve.gse.harvard.edu/screenshots</a></figcaption></figure>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">[Editor Heather interjects: the River City Multi User Virtual Environment (MUVE) is a great example of <strong>time manipulation</strong>. Learners had to determine the cause of 3 diseases in a city on a river. This built pedagogically went where learners often struggle: determining cause in a multi-variable (READ: real world, messy, wicked) system. The build could pause or speed up time--very helpful while waiting for bacteria to grow.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">With time paused in the middle of a process, visual cues can add positively to the instruction (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=v1uzCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;ots=TNCJnLhOfi&amp;dq=Clark%2C%20R.%20C.%2C%20%26%20Mayer%2C%20R.%20E.%20(2016).%20E-learning%20and%20the%20science%20of%20instruction%3A%20Proven%20guidelines%20for%20consumers%20and%20designers%20of%20multimedia%20learning.%20&amp;lr&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Clark &amp; Mayer</a>, 2016).</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">XR experiences can also reduce instructional time overall because the training can be delivered more efficiently to the learners. For example, workplace training that has been preloaded onto VR headsets can be shipped to remote workers, saving travel time.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">IDs should be aware that with this characteristic, <strong><i>many 2D simulations can do the same</i></strong> time manipulation and savings<strong><i> for possibly lower costs</i></strong>.</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__paragraph" style="text-align: left;"><strong>It Saves Money</strong></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">XR experiences can save money over other forms of learning. For example, it would cost a lot of money to take your learners to the Moon in real life. In XR, space travel is much cheaper.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh61GzuLeZd1EZi-VcsGR5PJ8RbFLeRZkZKshWjwI8AhO6dssjyflceln7JTjfGi5kYkL54AKTvujtyiUVe8ZyheFh4MulB-Q34_8IoxuozlGeHCpOwkS_rmqLcj6anMEuwwysY2aCWSivQUzCNyTJzE8ddCIWYyYpVc_z9o4wpLCAHtGG1OFyTZtcGHk4/w640-h340/Mission%20ISS.png" width="640" height="340" border="0" data-original-height="694" data-original-width="1309" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Capture from Mission: ISS.

Those unfamiliar with development trends might comment that the metaverse is not currently cheaper than other media. As of this writing, costs are dropping [Editor Heather reminds you that 1 of the 2 things<i> </i><a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/virtual-reality-soft-skillsmaybe-heather-dodds/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>I actually liked</i> about the PwC study was the calculation</a> that if you make a build for more than 3,000 users, it will be cheaper overall to do in XR versus e-learning] with the arrival of artificial-intelligence (AI) developed resources.¬†
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Immersive web (WebXR) options allow approximately 20 learners to join one virtual space with a web browser, no additional equipment. Development prices do rise with more complexity.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">One final note: the ‚Äòtime is money‚Äô statement does hold true here. Often, an XR experience that saves time also saves money.¬†¬†</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__paragraph" style="text-align: left;"><strong>It Reduces Danger</strong></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This characteristic, the metaverse reduces danger, also includes impossible activities. While <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://aperturesciencellc.com/vr/VisualDesignMethodsforVR_MikeAlger.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alger </a>(2015) properly suggested that any content that was inherently 3D in the first place is ideal for XR development, XR is not limited to the real and actual. It can expand to the phantasmagorical and impossible. For instance, taking learners to look inside of an operating nuclear reactor would be dangerous in real life. This can be replicated in XR with no added danger for the learners.¬†</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">IDs should remember that some environments in the metaverse can still represent psychological risk if not real danger. In the Proteus Effect, learners could change their behavior depending on what their avatar is experiencing (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Goerlich/publication/347582766_How_Avatars_Influence_User_Behavior_A_Review_on_the_Proteus_Effect_in_Virtual_Environments_and_Video_Games/links/624997f421077329f2eec0f7/How-Avatars-Influence-User-Behavior-A-Review-on-the-Proteus-Effect-in-Virtual-Environments-and-Video-Games.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Praetorius, &amp; G√∂rlich</a>, 2020). As a result, a learner‚Äôs avatar walking into fire might be a frightening experience even if it is physically safe. Examples of risks include claustrophobia, fear of heights, hostility, prejudices, and negative social pressures.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In all cases, IDs should keep the learner primarily in mind. If it scares a learner <i>and it was not meant to</i>, it should be removed from the design.</p>
<hr>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Let's take a short pause here-- we're about halfway through these articles and let's propose some questions.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Question:</strong> I know of some educational experiences that were VERY expensive to build, they cost a lot now, and they work great. Your formula would NOT necessarily predict their success.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Answer:</strong> The 'saving money' part is <strong>compared to the real world</strong>. So while I respect that some experiences are VERY expensive, I'm happy they work great. I just bet they are a LOT cheaper in XR than doing whatever it is in real life.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Q:</strong> <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://youtu.be/GOYrC1hH6Ak?si=6ez3Q6OAgkGLqybb" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Bailenson has his DICE formula</a>: <strong>D</strong>angerous,<strong> I</strong>mpossible, <strong>C</strong>ounterproductive, and <strong>E</strong>xpensive. Why should we remember your shorter "time, money, danger" version instead?</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> With all respect to Jeremy, he has a lot of advantages at getting his message out (white, male, Stanford, and so on). But I developed my list -- as best as I can tell-- simultaneously to his (my 1st publication on it is 2013). So I'm claiming <strong>co-evolution</strong> because I believe we were looking at the same pile of research up to that time. What I don't like about his list (even though yes, he's got an acronym and I don't) is that his list is counterintuitive to understand. The 4 conditions he lists are <strong>what should be present in the real world <i>to then consider using VR</i></strong>. They are not 'when you should use VR'--- because if they were, how would "counterproductive" make sense? BTW, if you don't understand his use of counterproductive, watch the video I linked to his name above.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Q:</strong> But you don't have Impossible on your list?</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> I subsume the impossible inside the dangerous. Cause it is <i>really</i> dangerous to do the impossible. üòâ</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Q:</strong> OK, last question. What if an experience does not save time, does not save money, and isn't less dangerous (relatively) than the real thing?</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Besides realizing that Parts 1-3 basically advised against even thinking to make that experience, I say "even a broken clock is right twice a day." There is always a chance, however low. These 3 guidelines are based on years of watching experiences rise and fall. Odd, surprising builds still happen and more luck to them.</p>

<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading">Myths versus Reality</h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The metaverse in education is an emerging topic and a potentially lucrative field, possibly set to supplant learning management systems as the next industry-wide educational platform (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://arpost.co/2023/02/10/extended-reality-learning-potential/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spilka</a>, 2023). Improvements in technology are fostering an ‚Äúanytime at anywhere‚Äù implementation of the metaverse (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40561-022-00205-x" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tlili, Huang, Shehata, et al.</a>, 2022, p. 4). As interest in the metaverse as educational media has increased, misleading claims or myths have already circulated. These myths are often shrouded under the title of research until the curious probe a little deeper. This part will examine claims such as the metaverse will cause learners to learn more and faster, it represents active learning and is therefore better, it is more immersive than ever, learners retain more, it increases empathy, and learners like it so therefore they learn better. This section will mention areas where the research is still unknown, publishing bias, and what to look for when IDs read educational research on the metaverse.</p>

</figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Learners in the metaverse will learn more and faster; this is the first claim examined. IDs should maintain a healthy skepticism of claims that a certain media causes dramatic learning improvements. Claims often do not communicate instructional methods as <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leonel-Morgado/publication/368434277_Educational_Practices_and_Strategies_with_Immersive_Learning_Environments_Mapping_of_Reviews_for_using_the_Metaverse/links/63ffc7680cf1030a5661703e/Educational-Practices-and-Strategies-with-Immersive-Learning-Environments-Mapping-of-Reviews-for-using-the-Metaverse.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beck, Morgado, and O‚ÄôShea (2023</a>) pointed out. Instead, current publishing focuses on outcomes-based research or what <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles-Reigeluth/publication/371304955_How_Do_We_Solve_a_Problem_Like_Media_and_Methods_207/links/647e04b6b3dfd73b7767f1d2/How-Do-We-Solve-a-Problem-Like-Media-and-Methods-207.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reigeluth and Honebein</a> called research-to-prove results that are ‚Äútypically operationalized by comparing a new medium to a traditional one‚Äù (2023, p. 2). For instance, a lesson in XR could be compared to a lesson in a textbook. Similarly, the <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.17226/24783" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine</a> advised that possible external validity of some studies is low in that ‚Äúthere is considerable evidence that a single instructional technology can lead to different outcomes when used by different learners in different contexts‚Äù (2018, p. 194). These claims usually represent the pitting of two very different instructional methods and thus cognitive workloads against each other.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Here is an example of this claim. In a study incorporating virtual reality (VR) headsets for soft skills training, Scott Likens of PricewaterhouseCoopers claimed, ‚ÄúWe found the realism and performance feedback in virtual reality simulations helped people learn faster and retain more information around soft skills,‚Äù (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/spring2021/pages/virtual-reality-training-spreads-its-wings.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zielinski, 2021</a>, para. 9). However, <strong>the accompanying published report contradicted these claims.</strong> When comparing information retention in VR versus an e-learning course, the authors ‚Äúquickly discovered retention scores were inconclusive, as the delta between pre and post-assessments in each modality was <strong>not significant</strong>‚Äù (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/technology/emerging-technology/assets/pwc-understanding-the-effectiveness-of-soft-skills-training-in-the-enterprise-a-study.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eckert &amp; Mower, 2020</a>, p. 44, emphasis added). Thus, the two different media showed no different learning outcomes.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Another claim is that the isolation effect of a headset causes faster learning, perhaps arguing that less distraction equals more focus. In the same study, Likens stated, ‚ÄúA lot of courses that normally take an hour could be completed in 20 minutes through VR because people are so immersed in scenarios, there are fewer distractions and the learning is very concentrated‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 10). Referring to the same study, ‚ÄúVR was x4 faster than classroom and x1.5 faster than e-learning‚Äù (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PXRJEAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=UpbIsA4SJU&amp;dq=learning%20experience%20design%20Clark&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. Clark, 2022</a>, p. 190). Claims that learning is completed faster attempt to represent XR as a more efficient learning method, i.e., less time to learn equals learning faster. When compared to classroom learning, it is already known that 1:1 personalized learning is faster. In this case, the classroom learning was allotted to two hours and the VR experience took 29 minutes. Given that 29 minutes is approximately one-quarter of two hours, the touted line was that XR was four times (4x) faster. <strong>In fact, the XR media did not cause the learning to be completed faster, it was the 1:1 nature of the learning experience. </strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">[Editor Heather here: this is the same study I wrote about <i>extensively</i> <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/virtual-reality-soft-skillsmaybe-heather-dodds" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/seeking-integrity-part-2-vr-soft-skills-heather-dodds-ph-d-" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and my colleagues wrote about <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://3starlearningexperiences.wordpress.com/2020/07/07/truth-or-truthiness-analysing-a-vr-study-using-gorards-sieve/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, in case you want to read more.]</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Further, there is at least one study that refutes this focusing-causes-faster-learning claim. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475217303274" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makransky, Terkildsen, &amp; Mayer</a> have found that immersive metaverse environments can be sensory overload for learners and therefore decrease the learner‚Äôs focus (2019). On the whole, claims for increased speed can often be attributed to more efficient learning methods.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lauding the media that manipulated instructional methods hides the fact that the learner could achieve the same results in a different media, given comparable time and resources.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Some claims state that learner-instigated avatar movement, in the form of moving hands, heads, or bodies, or the first-person point of view makes XR learning inherently active as opposed to passive. Intentional avatar movement is associated with manipulating content, which is the term embodiment or embodied learning (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2018.00081" rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnson-Glenberg</a>, 2018; <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02364" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markowitz, Laha, Perone, et al.</a>, 2018). The claim begins with the given that active learning is known to be better than passive learning. Because XR is body-movement active, it must be active learning and thus cause more learning¬† (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018). However, research has shown that while embodiment does have a connection to learning, it does not exclusively <strong><i>cause</i></strong> learning. Truly, ‚Äúplatform is not destiny‚Äù as <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elena-Kalina-2/publication/352059688_Platform_is_not_destiny_Embodied_learning_effects_comparing_2D_desktop_to_3D_virtual_reality_STEM_experiences/links/60fb097e169a1a0103b1e03b/Platform-is-not-destiny-Embodied-learning-effects-comparing-2D-desktop-to-3D-virtual-reality-STEM-experiences.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;_sg%5B1%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;origin=journalDetail" rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnson‚ÄêGlenberg, Bartolomea, &amp; Kalina</a> stated in 2021 (p. 20). <strong>Just putting a learning experience with movement into XR does not make it active learning.</strong></p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3 More Immersion</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">There are some claims that take issue with the second assumption stated earlier in this series: Learning outcomes are expected to be equal to other media (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayer</a>, 2020). These claims state that earlier comparative media studies did not show improved results because the technology then was older. Thus, technology now utilizes a better <i>quality</i> of immersion. This claim reflects a modernist philosophical approach: newer is better. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://stanfordvr.com/mm/2015/cummings-mp-how-immersive.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cummings and Bailenson</a> (2016) reported that head tracking, stereoscopic visuals, and wider fields of view created more immersion than other visual or audio improvements. Yet Mayer wrote in 2020, ‚Äúthese comparisons between low-immersion and high-immersion media <strong>do not provide strong evidence </strong>for the instructional value of converting a 2D lesson rendered on a computer screen into a 3D lesson displayed with a head-mounted display in immersive virtual reality‚Äù (p. 365). Moreover, <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ME.1943-5479.0001101" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abbas, Seoo, Ahn et al</a>. (2023) found that high levels of presence did not impact user behaviors. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frvir.2022.742509/full" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ochs and Sonderegger</a> (2022) reported that learners that felt an increased sense of presence in VR scored worse on measures of memorization even when the learner simultaneously self-reported that they expected to do better in VR versus 2D. Finally, Makransky, Terkildsen, &amp; Mayer found that VR causes more presence but less learning (2019).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Overall, these claims also fail to acknowledge that the main subject in media studies are humans (not the media), and we already know a great deal about how humans learn in 3D environments. These spaces exist outside of technology and are called classrooms. <strong>These claims that newer XR will cause more learning look more like calls to buy the latest technology. </strong></p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">4 Greater Retention</h3>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeVIw4VyaeF_v2Qt3DtcXjB31m0yIv3KMLfmVwFH-QLtHMvrf6FQGo34L2toNRxFYBap_Mkxiyf7DfSvGVY_wB8pADOv6Pf1YTJsVIb7HaxzuUmeYdz-OMTZmLwZMAZzeU0UTCZ-tP1qTL0SbLF6lxnwVbuiDxi5von8E_sibaVh-r5hyphenhyphen5hWuTwTsMUWE/w640-h478/better%20retention.png" alt="Capture of post with text: It has been proven that people learn better through an immersive experience and &quot;retain material better&quot;." width="640" height="478" border="0" data-original-height="784" data-original-width="1050" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Claim: better retention, "it has been proven". <br>Not so much.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This claim states that XR enhances knowledge retention (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://iprjb.org/journals/index.php/IJHR/article/view/2018" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victor</a>, 2023). Studies of retention are still ongoing and difficult to find. Indeed, broad reviews such as those conducted by <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40692-020-00169-2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamilton, McKechnie, Edgerton, and Wilson</a> (2021) commented that finding ‚Äúlearning outcomes, intervention characteristics, and assessment measures associated with immersive virtual reality use has been sparse‚Äù (2021, p. 1). This aligns with Beck, Morgado, and O‚ÄôShea who contended that, ‚ÄúVery few literature reviews focus on the educational practices and strategies used in immersive learning environments. Thus, the problem is that we are evaluating outcomes without a comparable way to describe the educational approaches that led to those outcomes‚Äù (2023, p. 2). Therefore, retention could be achieved with XR implementation, but without more research detail, greater results might be attributable to the method, not the media.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The use of the metaverse in education is not yet common. It is difficult to find studies that measure retention within learners <i>more than</i> 10 to 21 days after instruction. Practical workplace implementation would require much longer retention times. Therefore, <strong>this claim has not yet been supported or refuted</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">5 Increase Empathy</h3>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTiuHUYgPmwx1DRrK2BKH3_FIHYgdJ-sl2sFPhZyqJB8ZjMGLqtgowxJeGCUGcZHLj5mWTY5D2l5Pr_eapfXBUDuffKJXG0PindHmiMZxyVgzV514Br0Asjh2Bq7VYv8ti2fo7KXlxnX7GhbYDC1LpazQbirKS3qE-Rv0Bb2N5CGJoTXiTfSz-aHvwS78/w640-h396/empathy%20machine.png" alt="Capture of headline: Is VR the ultimate empathy machine?" width="640" height="396" border="0" data-original-height="449" data-original-width="726" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Someone seems to think so.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Research on empathy indicates that this is an area of risk. Because of a first-person point of view in many XR experiences, learners perceive a direct impact of the experience which is meant to foster empathy. However, empathy, like presence, is nuanced. Indeed, in some empathy research, learners did not react with a positive and caring response, but instead with disgust and rejection (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://sts.stanford.edu/publications/experience-demand-what-virtual-reality-how-it-works-and-what-it-can-do" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bailenson</a>, 2018). Thus, the objective of the experience might be not only missed but soured.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Clark, when writing about accessible pedagogy in immersive learning, advised to avoid first-person depictions of marginalized groups because XR experiences cannot portray the depth and spectrum of a person‚Äôs life. ‚ÄúInstead of teaching students what it‚Äôs like to be blind, consider having them deconstruct the ways vision is assumed in how spaces are designed, as well as the ways their understandings of vision impact how they interact with others,‚Äù then ‚Äúfocus on bringing awareness to the assumptions built into the physical world around them‚Äù (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://dlfteach.pubpub.org/pub/vol2-clark-recommendations-for-accessible-pedagogy-with-immersive-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer">J. Clark</a>, 2021, Recommended Administrative Considerations section, para. 4). Therefore, <strong>XR to foster empathy should be approached with extreme caution.</strong></p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">6 Learners and Instructors Like It</h3>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJfJP35szeqRXlKz4uKMYCHo6GVq5XPBRPWTZXRJ8tg2ffHodv3UQhyphenhyphenpEKy8odkezTZFGNsIoL9jSWPxZvGQZK2zYeQyZELqpaZUa2zeeMJvLFUwKcfAEeVHbqS_OdPVnjmyKicOsH8LnQefGG9hjgVLLw3vr8QQ6IjikR2WQjmfAQPKexZf0IuaVmTak/w640-h378/pwc%20edit%20on%20numbers.png" alt="Capture of impressively high &quot;more confident&quot; and &quot;more emotionally connected&quot; numbers from VR learning." width="640" height="378" border="0" data-original-height="409" data-original-width="693" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Forward-looking statements of optimistic activity. <br>Unfortunately NOT strongly connected to learning.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This learning claim, that learners liking a learning experience will then learn more, is perhaps the most common. To the contrary, there is no research-based connection between liking an experience and learning success (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/manuscript/2016-29687-001.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hughes, Gregory, Joseph, et al</a>., 2016; <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.unlv.edu/sites/default/files/page_files/27/Engineering-MetaAnalysis-BobUttl.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uttl, White, &amp; Gonzalez</a>, 2017) . <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.worklearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Thalheimer-The-Learning-Transfer-Evaluation-Model-Report-for-LTEM-v11.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thalheimer</a> further discounted the connection between learners liking their learning and achieving their learning, when he stated that ‚Äúmeasuring interest is an inadequate way of measuring learning‚Äù (2018, p. 26). Therefore, while it is pleasant for learners to enjoy an experience, it has no firm connection to a learning outcome. Beyond the learner, education professionals should use caution when thinking that emotional motivation will work <strong>over the long term</strong>. Instructors often become enthralled with possibilities of XR and start to believe that the feeling of being there (a combination of presence, embodiment, and immersion) will make a positive difference. <strong>Research and theory are not forecasting this.</strong> However, the flame of excitement among professionals should not be extinguished. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=v1uzCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;ots=TNCJkGdMdm&amp;dq=clark%20mayer&amp;lr&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clark and Mayer</a> advocated for a <i>tempered</i> approach where the ID can keep to the best learning practices and not be distracted by the media:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">‚ÄúThe challenge in e‚Äêlearning, as in any learning program, is to build lessons in ways that are compatible with human learning processes. To be effective, instructional strategies must support these processes. That is, they must foster the psychological events necessary for learning. While the computer technology for delivery of e‚Äêlearning is upgraded regularly, <strong>the human side of the equation‚Äîthe neurological infrastructure underlying the learning process‚Äîis very old</strong> and designed for change only over evolutionary time spans. In fact, technology can easily deliver more sensory data than the human nervous system can process. <strong>To the extent that attention‚Äêgrabbing audio and visual elements in a lesson interfere with human cognition, learning will be depressed</strong>‚Äù (2016, p. 24, emphasis added).</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">7 Near Versus Far Transfer</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Claims about near transfer outcomes will be addressed just ahead [look for Whitney]. Results showing positive far transfer from XR applications, however, are elusive in a similar way to the retention results. Research shows equivalent or mixed performance to traditional media (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.bendsawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kaplan-et-al-2020-VR-AR-and-MR-as-Training-Metaanalysis.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaplan, Cruit, Endsley, et al</a>., 2021; <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcal.12375" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makransky, Borre‚ÄêGude, &amp; Mayer</a>, 2019) or worse performance (Makransky, Terkildsen, &amp; Mayer, 2019; <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/manuscript/2018-03101-001.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parong &amp; Mayer</a>, 2018). In particular, Mayer offered the Immersion Principle in 2020 which stated: ‚ÄúPeople do not necessarily learn better in 3D immersive virtual reality than with a corresponding 2D desktop presentation‚Äù (p. 357).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Intuitively, because XR can replicate real world environments where the learning <i>would be applied</i>, far transfer seems like a reachable goal. (Tlili, Huang, Shehata, et al., 2022) wrote that the technology can enhance and allow for transfer. Johnson-Glenberg noted that despite requests for more research into XR, ‚Äúresources and affordable technologies were not readily available‚Äù (2018, p. 7) for educational research and that ‚Äúlongitudinal effects of VR exposure are unknown at this point‚Äù (2018, p. 11). <strong>It is possible that not enough time has passed for the research community to measure the ‚Äòfar‚Äô in far transfer.</strong> In general, the ability to do worked practice exercises repeatedly in simulated real-world contexts suggests that XR should be <strong>at least equivalent</strong> when compared to other media for far transfer.¬†</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">8 Positives Get Published</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Research with positive results is published more often than research with negative or no results. This is not unique to metaverse applications. This is known as <strong>publication bias</strong> or the file drawer problem (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10972-016-9475-2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lederman &amp; Lederman</a>, 2016). It limits the results of a meta-analysis because if a particular form of learning is not effective, it usually is not published (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-019-00051-3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cofr√©, N√∫√±ez., Santib√°√±ez et al.</a>, 2019). Thus, <strong>the published collection showing positive results with XR dominates over the no significant difference results.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">As an added caveat, IDs should closely examine research funding <i>sources</i> and <i>sponsors.</i></p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading">How Will I Know?</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTGCYNJCo-ElV90jmTLSlXR749fURmvs4oTaXDDQtU5-gNSHK3UxsWOdWX1y4zijMATv3GbgXzB8UhA5_wKwNYDD1Sv0eqr4STH7JWzRxhAAk9Lqmb7PpYDZBBVd6jDagdidaCEgGjsnweL8GtFGmjqNQW2yXJeWW9Huo9X2dJ7wutUWbBV0rucnzsN7I/w640-h640/How%20will%20I%20know%20Whitney%20Houston.jpeg" alt="Single cover of How Will I Know?

Who doesn't love Whitney, helping out with instructional design?</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">IDs are cautioned to examine metaverse research studies for these two major characteristics:</p>
<ol class="article-editor-content__ordered-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Novelty effect.</strong> The novelty effect is when learners are exposed to a new media and they engage in increased effort and attention. It tends to positively impact learning outcomes (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/transitions-in-student-motivation-during-a-muve-based-ecosystem-science-curriculum/230841" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metcalf, Chen, Kamarainen, et al</a>., 2019) but not always (Huang, Roscoe, Johnson‚ÄêGlenberg, et al., 2021). Further, "studies of virtual reality-based learning are based on only short-term implementations, and although they might show statistically significant learning outcomes, the novelty effect is an important caveat to the research because many of these studies do not account for the decay of outcomes over longer periods of time." (Metcalf, Chen, Kamarainen et al., 2019, p. 97)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>If a research study implements a one-time 20-minute XR intervention and claims to show learning improvement, the learners are likely experiencing the novelty effect.</strong></p>
<ol class="article-editor-content__ordered-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Non-cognitively comparable methods.</strong> Studies where the learner is not put into the same cognitive workload with two different media should be viewed with skepticism over claims of better results (Reigeluth &amp; Honebein, 2023). For example, if a study stated that learners performed better in XR than paper-and-pencil-based learning, the results should be discounted due to the varying cognitive impact that the different media had on the learner (Parong &amp; Mayer, 2021). In one example, the experimental learner group was exposed to VR training after the standard training and then scored higher than the control group (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1422600/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seymour, Gallagher, Roman, et al.</a>, 2002). The total training time increased. <i>This could have caused higher scores.</i> The two conditions, therefore, were not comparable. Furthermore, <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.17226/24783" rel="noopener noreferrer">the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</a> noted that the prevalence of WEIRD populations (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) used in educational research inherently exclude diverse learner populations and this makes it difficult to draw solid conclusions for all humans in all learning situations (2018). Thus <strong>what works for one group of learners might not work, nor even be comparable, for another group.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Clark and Mayer summarized how to examine research claims for e-learning, but these questions equally apply to XR research.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Does the effect size favor the experimental group at a 0.5 level or higher (2016, p. 63)?"</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Longer term and wider implementation decisions, however, should be made more systematically, by thinking and rethinking the design decisions over time. IDs rarely have control over the large financial decisions that XR development requires, so their role can be one of consultant: offering all the options and pros and cons of each to the decision makers (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://edtechbooks.org/id_highered/immersive_learning_e" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dodds</a>, 2021).

                <p id="ember1246" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This conceptual series proposes instructional design principles for the metaverse. You've arrived at Part 2 where I cover theory, application, and scope. </span></p>
<p id="ember1247" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> If you are a theory nerd like me, you'll love this part. If not, hang on to your butts.¬†</span></p>
<h2 class="ember-view"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Theory and application</span></h2>
<p id="ember1249" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Metaverse educational experiences, as replications of known reality, <i>can draw from every major learning theory already in existence</i> because metaverse experiences are often <strong>copies</strong> of the real world. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2022_404">Checa and Bustillo</a> asserted that constructivism, behaviorism, cognitivism, and connectivism can be foundations for a wide variety of XR pedagogical approaches (2023). However, the specific affordances of presence and embodiment in the metaverse indicate that existing approaches that include simulations and experiential learning are applicable (Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023; <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00081/full?source=post_page---------------------------">Johnson-Glenberg, 2018</a>; <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=csqLAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=reigeluth&amp;ots=7I8aePlS1h&amp;sig=3pERHpIXV66BoY1VuGBfXT2e8d8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Reigeluth, &amp; Carr-Chellman, 2009</a>). Specifically, cognitivism and constructivism theories are often cited for the metaverse. </span></p>
<p id="ember1250" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> On the other hand, there is new research calling for more nuanced theories that reflect the social and learner-centered environments in the metaverse, e.g. connectivism or complexity theory (Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11423-021-10005-8">Schmidt &amp; Glaser, 2021</a>). Cognitivism and constructivism will be expanded upon here as they relate to research and application, beginning with cognitivism. </span></p>
<p id="ember1251" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Cognitive learning theory historically reflects the strong influence from the computer science discipline wherein XR applications are understood as input/output platforms controlled by programming. Learner experiences are transactional and computational. A learner is faced with a choice, they take that choice, and the program reacts. As such, the experiences appear to have a cause-and-effect flow with computers and learners both mediating the processing. For instructional designers specifically, a deeper understanding of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, where visuals and audio have been studied with respect to learning, is required to apply the advice within Section 4 of this series.</span></p>
<p id="ember1252" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Theories begin with a set of assumptions based on observation. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview">Mayer‚Äôs (2020</a>) cognitive theory of multimedia design has three critical assumptions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Dual channel:</strong> Humans can accept information only via sight and sound inputs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Limited capacity:</strong> Humans have neuronal limits as to how fast information can be sensed, kept in working memory, and then moved to long-term memory.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Active processing:</strong> Humans bring prior experiences to their learning and actively think about information as they are processing it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p id="ember1253" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Based on those assumptions, the cognitive theory of multimedia design focuses on the human processing system.¬†</span></p>

<p id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1256" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> There are two input channels (eyes and ears) where words and pictures enter sensory memory, then processing through working memory where sounds and images may interchange and conflict, finally moving to long term memory where information is integrated into prior knowledge. Words can be sensed by both eyes and ears. Selecting which words to focus on can cause conflict because the brain converts words to sounds inside of processing. This increases cognitive workload if an external voice is speaking while the learner‚Äôs internal voice is reading. This theory is relevant in that immersive experiences can provide words, voices, and graphics which, <i><strong>when simultaneously present</strong></i> in working memory, can increase cognitive workload, making long-term learning difficult. Because XR can provide an immersive environment of words, text, and sound surrounding learners, the risk is high that learners could be exposed to these cognitive conflicts. Section 4 will explore these pitfalls and how to avoid them. I will look briefly at constructivism next.¬†</span></p>
<p id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1257" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Constructivist learning theory postulates that learners construct their knowledge through experience; learners do not arrive as blank slates. With a wide variety of possibilities of the metaverse, IDs can think that constructivism represents a constantly growing approach to learning - learners could even create objects in 3D to construct their knowledge. However, a closer examination of this theory is required. In constructivism, new knowledge is connected to older knowledge in a way similar to the act of construction, just as boards are attached one upon another to build up a building. For IDs, constructivist theory appears both while designing step-wise learning experiences and in knowing that learners arrive in XR <i>with preconceptions from prior experiences</i> (Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023). It is in these preconceptions that learners will recognize and begin to process the experience. For example, if a learner arrives in an office building XR environment, they may begin to process the experience as work training. In this way, the learner might not need to be prompted that work behaviors are expected.¬†</span></p>
<h2 id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Givens</span></h2>
<p id="ember1259" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> It is important to note that both of these theories keep <strong>the learner,</strong> not the technology, <strong>primarily in mind</strong> when thinking of how learning will occur. Drawing from the indicated research, two further assumptions are held in this series and will be treated as givens:</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Learners experience the virtual as real. (<a href="https://sts.stanford.edu/publications/experience-demand-what-virtual-reality-how-it-works-and-what-it-can-do">Bailenson, 2018</a>, p. 46)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Learning outcomes are expected to be equal to other media. (Mayer, 2020, p. 357)</span></li>
</ol>
<p id="ember1260" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1261" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Understanding how theory informs daily practice and design requires some finesse as rarely does an ID wake up and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to design pure cognitivist lessons today.‚Äù </span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<blockquote id="ember1262" class="ember-view"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Instead,<strong> theory provides the guide when the ID is facing a decision where the better path is not apparent. </strong></span></blockquote>
<p id="ember1263" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Theories offer ‚Äúguidelines on motivations, learning processes and learning outcomes for the learners‚Äù (Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023, p.5). A theory can point to methods, approaches, and strategies. Indeed, the mistake of not drawing upon a learning theory that is apparent in earlier research should not be repeated (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leonel-Morgado/publication/368434277_Educational_Practices_and_Strategies_with_Immersive_Learning_Environments_Mapping_of_Reviews_for_using_the_Metaverse/links/63ffc7680cf1030a5661703e/Educational-Practices-and-Strategies-with-Immersive-Learning-Environments-Mapping-of-Reviews-for-using-the-Metaverse.pdf">Beck, Morgado, &amp; O‚ÄôShea</a>, 2023; Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023; <a href="https://moodle2.units.it/pluginfile.php/562229/mod_resource/content/2/Brit%20J%20Educational%20Tech%20-%202014%20-%20Fowler%20-%20Virtual%20reality%20and%20learning%20%20Where%20is%20the%20pedagogy.pdf">Fowler, 2015</a>).</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p id="ember1264" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Overall, this series lands squarely within <a href="https://archive.org/details/pasteursquadrant00stok">Pasteur's Quadrant</a>, contributing to both fundamental and practical applications (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36741-4.pdf">Shi &amp; Evans, 2023</a>).¬†</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Pasteur's Quadrant: The type of research that quests for fundamental understanding AND can be used every day, like pasteurization. This article series lands in that sweet spot.</span></p>
<p id="ember1267" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This series is fundamental because it draws primarily from the cognitive theory of multimedia design and it examines research designs and results. It is practical in that it provides many examples based on the author‚Äôs XR design experiences. (You'll see, it's coming in a future Part.) As Mayer suggested, this type of approach is ‚Äúbasic research in applied situations‚Äù (2020, p. 22). Pasteur‚Äôs Quadrant lends light on exploratory topics. In this case, I have some basic theory from 2D learning, but there is much more 3D nuance unknown. Progress in this field will require that theory and applied research move forward hand in hand. </span></p>
<p id="ember1264" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1268" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Fortunately, being in Pasteur‚Äôs quadrant provides hints at further unanswered puzzles beyond this series. For example, what is the connection between the popular XR game emotional coinage of fear and successful XR applications for the training of the emergency services: fire, police, military, and medical personnel? The answer to that quest will wait for another day. Before I begin an examination of research myths (upcoming Part 3), I need to explain what can and cannot be covered in a series of this breadth.</span></p>
<h2 class="ember-view"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Scope</span></h2>
<p id="ember1270" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> This series leaves many topics by the wayside: defining the metaverse in education, qualifying and categorizing experiences, affordances and constraints, and accessibility options. Doubtless, each of those topics deserves a series of its own [note to self] but there is no space to address them here. This series does provide insight into four areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">interpreting research to rout out myths</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">looking for the characteristics of success in XR educational designs</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">using ID theory to inform the building blocks of design</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">tips for implementing an XR design project.</span></li>
</ul>
<p id="ember1271" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1272" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> The specific research gap that this series addresses is the missing connection between known design principles and practical applications of ID in the metaverse. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370221242_The_Immersion_Principle_in_Multimedia_Learning">Makransky</a> commented on the lack of connection between the cognitive theory of multimedia design and instructional design in virtual reality,¬† stating that ‚Äúresearch that has investigated instructional design implications in immersive learning environments is severely limited‚Äù (2023, p. 5). Beck, Morgado, and O‚ÄôShea surveyed that ‚Äúmostly papers discuss opportunities and challenges or compare outcomes, rather than expose details on educational practices or strategies‚Äù (2023, p. 2).¬† Reigeluth and Honebein suggested that research-to-prove should be replaced with research-to-improve when a technology is in its early developmental stage (2023). Such research should limit itself to suggesting ‚Äúpossible ideas for actions and improvement‚Äù (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles-Reigeluth/publication/371304955_How_Do_We_Solve_a_Problem_Like_Media_and_Methods_207/links/647e04b6b3dfd73b7767f1d2/How-Do-We-Solve-a-Problem-Like-Media-and-Methods-207.pdf">Reigeluth &amp; Honebein, 2023</a>, p. 2). Finally, the emergent use of XR technology has precipitated haphazard designs lacking guidance:</span></p>
<p id="ember1273" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> "In these early days, trial and error plays an outsized role in design. Education researchers borrow heavily from the entertainment designers, who focus on engagement, and not necessarily on retention of content. The dearth of studies highlights the urgency for a set of guidelines for designing content that allows users to make appropriate choices in a spherical space." (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018, p. 7).</span></p>
<p id="ember1274" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> It is hoped that this series lends to two facets of instructional design. First, the <strong>thinking</strong> side of design, when a designer must choose one approach or another. This series strives to give the best advice. Second, the <strong>implementing</strong> side of design where designers arrive directly into the metaverse to see what their learners will experience. This series, then, points the way.¬†</span></p>
<p id="ember1274" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Part 3 will approach research myths surrounding the metaverse in education.¬†¬†</span></p>

<p id="ember2121" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This article series intends to provide guidance for instructional designers entering this new and rapidly changing space by straddling between what is known and unknown in instructional design in the metaverse. Early research that addresses the metaverse ‚Äútends to focus on outcomes-based research while neglecting the important details of how something was accomplished‚Äù (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leonel-Morgado/publication/368434277_Educational_Practices_and_Strategies_with_Immersive_Learning_Environments_Mapping_of_Reviews_for_using_the_Metaverse/links/63ffc7680cf1030a5661703e/Educational-Practices-and-Strategies-with-Immersive-Learning-Environments-Mapping-of-Reviews-for-using-the-Metaverse.pdf">Beck, Morgado, &amp; O‚ÄôShea, 2023</a>, p. 1). Studies can also target emergent cause-and-effect or comparison relationships and <strong>ignore</strong> known educational practices and principles. Quests can contain grand promises, spurring a rush to implement, followed by unmet hopes and expectations (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview">Mayer, 2020</a>, p. 13). If administrators determine that the metaverse does contain unmet hopes, future funding for uses that truly could change education for the better will dry up.</span></p>
<p id="ember2122" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> After this first Introduction section, the second of eight sections will examine <strong>research myths</strong> in the educational metaverse. These myths include that the metaverse will cause more learning at a faster rate and reach learners in new ways. I will look closely at what the research currently says for and against seven specific claims. In the third section, I will look at what the research is pointing to as <strong>characteristics of success</strong> when considering the incorporation and implementation of the metaverse. The characteristics do not seem to arrive in popular metaverse claims, but like the slow and steady tortoise, they seem to predict the winners of the race. In Sections 4 and 5, I will cover the detailed work of instructional design, targeting especially <strong>what we already know about multimedia learning</strong> and what will be uncovered in the metaverse. Section 6 will discuss <strong>the current limitations</strong> of using research to drive instructional design in the metaverse. Finally, Sections 7 and 8 are written to leave the reader with<strong> hope and soaring possibilities</strong> in mind. Because instructional design in the metaverse is an emergent topic, some discoveries are yet to arrive to their eureka moments; those will fall completely outside of our prediction. Thus, this series will have 8 sections but innumerable (until it is done) parts. </span></p>

<div class="ivm-view-attr__img-wrapper display-flex" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">¬†This conceptual series will propose instructional design principles for the metaverse</span>.</div>
<div class="ivm-view-attr__img-wrapper display-flex">
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Approach</h2>
</div>
<div class="ivm-view-attr__img-wrapper display-flex">
<p id="ember2125" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This article series explores the topic with an evidence-based learner-centric approach. That approach fits best for instructional design, a discipline that considers the learning needs of the learner first and foremost. This chapter does not support the use of the metaverse in education for the sake of the cross or extended reality (XR) technology itself, which could be considered a technology-centered approach (Mayer, 2020).</span></p>
<p id="ember2125" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<blockquote>Instead, metaverse solutions should be selected when they are best fit for the instructional situation at hand. In many cases, they will be. But in some cases, <strong>they will not</strong>.</blockquote>
<p id="ember2127" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> This series strives to illuminate the characteristics and conditions to consider while keeping the learner and not the technology in the center of focus.</span></p>
<p id="ember2128" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> While maintaining that learner focus, this series will use several vocabulary terms and acronyms. Terms such as metaverse, cross reality, or¬† extended reality (XR) will be used interchangeably to refer to the entire technological incorporation. However, this author will use XR to refer more often to the technologies, i.e. hardware and software (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58948-6_4">Ziker, Truman, &amp; Dodds, 2021</a>), and metaverse to refer to a computer-mediated experience whether it is a game, application, or platform. Two-dimensional (2D) experiences, including monitors and simulations, will often be juxtaposed with three-dimensional (3D) experiences, including headsets or the immersive web (WebXR). The terms instructional design (ID) and instructional designers (IDs) are only separated by the discipline of how people learn and how to design instruction to help that process <i>versus </i>being the one who practices it. Nevertheless, popular terms like learning experience design (LXD) and learning experience designers (LXDs) convey equivalent meaning to aims and mission of instructional design. This chapter will refer to any planned 3D educational interactions as experiences. Indeed, the wide variety of vocabulary and terms is ‚Äúa characteristic of the early evolution of a branch of technology‚Äù (<a href="https://edtechbooks.org/id_highered/immersive_learning_e">Dodds, 2021</a>, para. 5). </span></p>
