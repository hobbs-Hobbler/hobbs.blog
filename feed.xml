                <p><span style="font-family: arial;">The next myth is that learning in immersive experiences is active, kinesthetic, or like an internship, which is ‚Äúthe way most people learn best‚Äù (D‚ÄôAgostino, 2022, para 17.) Spoiler: no it is not.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Active learning was first associated with immersive experiences because learners could observe or engage with or, more properly described, engage within simulations (Dede, 2009). The term active simply meant that the learner was present at a simulated place and time; the original use of the active learning phrase with reference to immersive experiences did not imply that a learner could do anything other than observe. The emphasis was much more on the time and space travel afforded by XR.<br><br>This claim has been controversial (Khorasani et al., 2023), in part because of the differing degrees of activity that a learner can have - ranging from simply being inside an immersive environment and observing (e.g. historical re-enactment simulations) to taking actions that have non-trivial consequences (e.g. practicing a surgical technique).<br><br></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Active learning is a phrase on the move</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Dede (2009) referred to <strong>actional immersion</strong> as situations where learner actions have ‚Äúnovel, intriguing consequences‚Äù that are ‚Äúhighly motivating and sharply focus attention.‚Äù (p. 66). The active learning claim moved from a focus on the <strong><i>learner‚Äôs actions</i></strong> and instead focused on the <strong><i>learner‚Äôs body ownership</i></strong> illusion. Further, the relationship between user bodies and virtual depictions (avatars) was reformulated and later called <strong>implicit learning</strong> (Slater, 2017, p. 29). <br><br>I want to pause here and really dissect the difference because in this area, there has definitely been vocabulary "drift".¬† Learner's actions focus on what the learner causes to happen.¬† Learner's body ownership focuses on parts of the body that the learner uses to cause actions.<br><br>For example, picture a chemistry lab simulation. </span></p>

They are using a mouse and moving their hand generally right to left.¬† No hand needs to be visible to do these actions. Activities could be "ghost like" in that they could be caused by no visual physical object whatsoever.¬† In reality, the computer mouse is doing the most physical 'work'.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Focusing on the <strong>learner's body ownership</strong> however, would have the learner reaching out (they need to be able to reach) to the pipette, to grab it (they need to be able to firmly grasp), to possible depress the button on the top to create the needed suction, to move the pipette, see the liquid and subsequent vial, and depress the button to dispense the liquid. The movements could be all right to left. Key in this visual depiction, however, is A HAND with workable fingers that is somehow connection via experience to a learner's IRL hand.<br><br><br>In the former example, the learner causes the actions to occur but we are not focused on their body parts doing the action. In the latter example, we are very interested in the body parts doing work that is replicate (in this case) to the real world work of operating a pipette. In the former, we could have confidence that a learner is exposed to the cause and effect of pipette work; it sucks up a reliable amount of liquid and can squirt it back out. In the latter, we could have confidence that a learner is exposed to how pipettes physically work (button press down equal prime for suck, release equals suck, button press down again equals squirt).¬† <br><br>See that the focus is different?<br><br>My point is that the FOCUS of what was coming to be called <strong><i>active learning</i></strong> with reference to XR was changing already between 2009 and 2017.</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Drawing from the educational history of the Montessori method and considering the interfaces available within immersive experiences, implicit bodily learning (from 2017) transformed to <strong>embodied learning</strong> (by 2018). Indeed, Johnson-Glenberg initially postulated that ‚Äúdoing actual physical gestures in a virtual environment should have positive, and lasting, effects on learning in the real world‚Äù (2018, p. 1). <i>Movement became synonymous with active learning</i>. ‚ÄúActive, motor-driven concepts may stimulate distributed semantic networks (meaning), as well as the associated motor cortices which would have been used to learn long ago, in childhood‚Äù (Johson Glenberg, 2018 p. 3). [Hat tip, by the way to all research into the mind-body connection within learning. This post throws no shade on the phenomena.] With specific, other than meaningful, actions now excluded, some researchers appeared to support the claim that all movement somehow begets learning. (That sentence is confusing, I wrote it and even I'm wondering what I meant. It's this: Inside a XR-for-learning experience, a learner might be instructed to do something. Pick this up, move it there.¬† Because that learning is specific to the learning event, I'm setting it aside. It's not part of this argument.¬† What I am referring to are the learner-instigated but non-instructed movements. Let's say, a learner joins XR and wanders to the left for 2 minutes before a lesson begins. Or let's say instead of looking to the "front" at the end of the experience, the learner is looking to the "back". These random but learner-instigated actions are...wait for it...somehow the secret sauce of learning in XR.¬† I kid you not. I really try to pin down the meaning from educators that belief this myth and THIS is what they come up with; because you can move in XR, you are learning (more) in XR.<br></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Did you catch that? Aren't the emperor's new clothes splendid?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">By incorporating the word ‚Äúactive‚Äù educators are reminded of the belief that active learning is better than passive learning (Slater, 2017). Ooo! Shade thrown there, for sure, because no teacher wants to be accused of being a passive educator.<br><br></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[BTW, there is reams of garbage research out there for anyone looking for a topic. Go ahead and dig into active versus passive in educational psychology papers. It's almost as big of a research garbage dump as XR; teachers radically redefine and appeal to this topic. My point is that the appeal to "active learning" when coupled with XR provides scant evidence of such. To this day, I RARELY see active learning in XR.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Let's bear down now. To be specific, the 'active learning' coupling with 'XR' claim is not about being fidgety, randomly moving about, or purely reacting as a user would in a game. It is movement, usually performed by the learner via an avatar or minimally via hand controllers where the learner is autonomously and purposely manipulating content.¬† This is known as embodiment or embodied learning (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018; Markowitz et al., 2018) although definitions of embodiment vary. The definitions vary including how much a learner is embodied. It should also be noted that the term<i> embodiment</i> is often used interchangeably with ‚Äòembodied learning‚Äô, which is a theory that the meaningful gestures in and with the environment aid a learner‚Äôs cognitive processes (that's the no shade thing I referred to earlier). But even 'embodiment' and 'embodied learning' are slightly different things. Whew! Keeping up?<br></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Emperor's clothes <em>should be</em> splendid </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>In 2018, Johnson-Glenberg claimed that presence and embodiment were ‚Äúprofound affordances‚Äù of immersive environments and this embodiment affordance should facilitate learner control, also known as agency (p. 1). One further hat tip to Mina: she did actually use a somewhat scientific body action in her research --I believe it was catching butterflies with a butterfly net-- something that biologists WOULD do with their bodies. So it's a real world action.¬† I point this out because some XR actions are nonsensical. I'm looking at you people who change vocabulary words to bouncing balls or something.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But aren't</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>A follow-up paper by Mina, however, found that while embodiment does have a connection to learning, it does not exclusively cause learning, or perhaps better said,<strong> it doesn't interact with learning</strong>. Referring to high or low embodied VR and the connection to learning, ‚Äúplatform is not destiny‚Äù (Johnson‚ÄêGlenberg et al., 2021, p. 20). So in lay talk that means it had no effect.</span></p>

Because active learning is considered better than passive learning, claims are made that immersive experiences must cause more learning due to the body-movement connection. The research, however, does not support that claim.<br><br>The active learning myth appears to be referred to more often in academic literature than evidence to the contrary. It is true that immersive experiences can allow for more movement-based learning experiences than other forms of media, but it is not definitive that immersive experiences cause learning simply because they can contain learner movement or agency.</span></p>

<h1>Myth: Learners learn more in immersive experiences</h1>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>This¬†<span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">myth shrouds itself within a cloak of research. Citations will state that learning in immersive experiences is somehow greater when pitted against an <i>implied</i> traditional learning approach. The claim could appear as retention, but it is related to how well the learning was accomplished when measured up against learning objectives or a final goal.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">When referring to the PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC) report results mentioned earlier in this article series, Scott Likens claimed, ‚ÄúWe found the realism and performance feedback in virtual reality simulations helped people learn faster and retain more information around soft skills,‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 9). He claimed they <strong>retained more information</strong>. This specific claim has been <i>repeated</i> in academic literature, which stated, ‚ÄúStudies have found that students who use XR training are more engaged with the content, display more confidence with the material, and retain more information than students who use traditional training methods.‚Äù (Rode, 2024, para 2.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">A close examination of the PwC report, however, reveals that the claim was unsupported within the report‚Äôs own data. When comparing information retention in VR versus an e-learning course, the authors ‚Äúquickly discovered retention scores were inconclusive, as the delta between pre-and post-assessments in each modality was not significant‚Äù (Eckert &amp; Mower, 2020, p. 44). Thus, there was no statistical difference between VR-based, e-learning, and traditional classroom learning.</span></p>

<p>The r<span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">eport therefore does not provide statistical evidence of more or greater learning within VR, yet it has been cited in academic publications (O'Dwyer, 2021, Etienne et al., 2022,¬† Jelki et al., 2022; B√§ckelin, 2023; Etienne et al., 2023; L√∏nne et al,. 2023) and touted in media outlets (Murad, 2023; Schwantes, 2020). For the dubious claims, the report has been debunked as untrustworthy (Neelen &amp; Kirschner, 2020).¬†</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">There are similar claims about greater learning retained from immersive experiences. Advocates for digital twin campus environments claimed that they ‚Äúcreate greater retention of the information that is learned‚Äù (D‚ÄôAgustino, 2022, para. 5) and ‚Äústudents' grades go up‚Äù (Victory XR, 2024, Who We Are).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">In another example, the CEO of the Miami Children‚Äôs Health System touted that learners had 80% retention after one year after using VR, but traditional learners had 20% retention. A close look at the supporting documentation shows that the CEO actually said that the difference between VR learners and traditional learners can be the 80% to 20% difference.¬†</span></p>

The CEO explained their claim by saying that, ‚ÄúThe level of understanding through VR is great because humans are primarily visual, and VR is a visual format‚Äù (Gaudiosi, 2021, para. 4).

Some claims are extreme. One keynote speaker, Alvin Graylin, speaking as a leader at HTC (a VR headset maker) declared that as a result of VR use in the classroom, ‚ÄúEvery single child has the potential to be a genius‚Äù (Educators in VR, 2020, 23:33).</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Justification for the greater learning or retention claims seems to be conjecture. Claims refer to how real an immersive experience feels to a learner. Returning to the PwC report, Likens credited ‚Äúthe realism and performance feedback‚Ä¶helped people..retain more information.‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 9). But <strong>long term studies measuring retention are hard to find</strong> within the body of academic literature. Some studies measure retention three weeks after the immersive experiences. Given that many of the examples of immersive experiences relate to hands-on disciplines like nursing or construction, things learned in immersive experiences would be needed on the job more than three weeks after the training.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Hamilton et al. (2020) stated that finding ‚Äúlearning outcomes, intervention characteristics, and assessment measures associated with immersive virtual reality has been sparse‚Äù (p. 1). Beck, Morgado, and O‚ÄôShea (2023) pointed out that details of methods are missing so that outcomes become questionable, ‚ÄúVery few literature reviews focus on the educational practices and strategies used in immersive learning environments. Thus, the problem is that we are evaluating outcomes without a comparable way to describe the educational approaches that led to those outcomes‚Äù (p. 2). Lawson et al. (2024) completed a systematic review of immersive experiences and found that research studies rarely isolate instructional methods and conditions when describing research studies and thus impact real world classroom decisions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Meta analyses are starting to illuminate this area. Akg√ºn and Atƒ±cƒ± (2022) observed that there was only a moderate effect on learner achievement after surveying 31 studies. Kaplan, Cruit, Endsley, Beers, Sawyer and Hancock found that ‚ÄúXR does not express a different outcome than training in a non-simulated, control environment. It is equally effective at enhancing performance‚Äù (2020, p. 1) Some researchers are starting to incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence into this challenge in order to determine what the published records states about immersive experiences. Markowitz et al. (2024) recently surveyed 196,734 paper abstracts with this method.</span></p>

<p data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">I find this myth is misleading.

                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Dispelling Myths</h1>
<p>With some background established on boom and bust cycles in the hype for immersive experiences (Parts <a href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/10/from-myths-to-principles-navigating.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>, <a href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-immersive-environment-delusion-part.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a>, and <a href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/11/part-3-case-against-virtual-campuses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3</a>), we need to dismiss the rather rampant myths about learning within immersive experiences. In the hype, learning advantages have been overstated and over simplified. Web pages post outrageous claims (and I‚Äôll show you!). Keynote presentations banty incredible promises (yup, it was recorded). This series addresses the four primary myths about learning within immersive experiences: that is, that it is faster, greater, active, and induces empathy. <br><br>In this Part 4, I‚Äôll address the ‚Äúlearners learn faster in immersive experiences‚Äù myth. For those of you that follow my writing, you‚Äôll know that this is Round 3 of me taking on this myth. My argument has not changed; remember this article series is an update, but not every point needs updating. However, I continue to communicate about this because the ‚ÄúVR learning is faster‚Äù myth continues to circulate‚Äì mostly in the reference to ‚Äú4 times faster‚Äù and the PwC report. So, TLDR, the VR experience was designed to be 29 minutes long. That‚Äôs it. No longer. The classroom equivalent in content experience was designed to be 2 hours long. That‚Äôs it. 29 minutes is ¬º of 120 minutes. Someone inverted ¬º to 4x (which is factually true) and PwC who appears to have had a cozy contract with Oculus/Meta at the time, went out to trumpet the ‚Äòfour times‚Äô from the rooftops. But students do NOT learn faster. They experienced a learning event that was designed to be faster. Had the learners spent 120 minutes in the headset, someone would have probably greedily snatched the headset off their heads and told them that they overstayed their welcome (and wondered what they were doing for the extra 91 minutes).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Myth: Learners learn faster in immersive experiences</h2>
<p>The first myth asserts that learners learn faster with immersive experiences. Particularly, the phrase ‚Äúfour times faster‚Äù has taken root in the publications and in public discourse. A google search on the phrase ‚ÄúVR is 4 times faster‚Äù returns a plethora of results repeating the myth.</p>

And it's not hard to catch, yo.</figcaption></figure>
<p><br>The source of this phrase is suggested to be one non-peer reviewed industry report by PricewaterhouseCooper. Within the report, VR-based learning was ‚Äú4x faster than classroom training on average‚Äù (Eckert &amp; Mower, 2020, p. 8). The results of this report were then repeated in academic literature.</p>

<p>Referring to the same report, D. Clark (an educational researcher not known for getting data wrong, but he did) wrote enthusiastically that ‚ÄúVR was x4 faster than classroom and x1.5 faster than e-learning‚Äù (2021, p. 190). Claims that learning is completed faster attempt to represent immersive experiences as a more efficient learning method, i.e., less time to learn equals learning faster.</p>
<p><br>Tracking down how many academic papers have cited the PwC report is difficult. I've seen numbers as little as 4 citations and much higher numbers if I start flexing my search. Part of the problem is that folks have not cited the report (even though it calls itself a study) correctly. Some credit PwC, a few find the Eckert and Mower authors, but in general the hand wave approach to referring to the 4x data is very prevalent.</p>
<p><br><br>The cause of this supposed faster learning was attributed to how a VR headset isolates the learner‚Äôs perception, so that the learner is focused on the learning task at hand. In other words, less distraction equals more focus. In the PricewaterhouseCooper report, Likens seemed to hypothesize that, ‚ÄúA lot of courses that normally take an hour could be completed in 20 minutes through VR because people are so immersed in scenarios, there are fewer distractions and the learning is very concentrated‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 10). <br><br>To be clear, in the PwC case, classroom learning which covered the same content was designed to take two hours to complete. The immersive experience was designed to take 29 minutes. Given that 29 minutes is approximately one-quarter of two hours, PwC inverted the time ratio and touted the line that the immersive learning was four times faster. The problem is that it is not true that learning in the immersive experience was faster. The VR-based learning took less time because it was designed to be a 29-minute one-on-one learning experience designed for a shorter total time duration. When compared to classroom learning, it is already known that one-on-one personalized learning is generally faster; it moves at the speed of the learner, not at the speed of the class. Perhaps, this is how myths begin. A kernel of truth gets extended to something with no context. Lack of context is a noted and rising problem in educational research (Williamson, 2024).<br><br>Learning faster can be confused with greater efficiency. Efficiency could have a wide range of meanings beyond just taking less time. It could also mean wiser use of resources or less teaching burden on the instructor. Another example of the loose wordplay is on an industry webpage that displayed that VR training was 50% faster than a traditional in-person medical simulation. Not stated in the distilled summary of that study is that <em>learners scored worse in the VR training than the traditional</em> in-person medical simulation (Katz et al., 2020).</p>

<p><br><br>The myth that learning happens faster continues when educators fail to acknowledge that a different instructional method was being used. When supporting using virtual reality for chemistry studies, Muhsinah Morris, a chemistry professor and metaverse program director at Morehouse said ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt see molecules, but in my virtual reality classroom where I taught advanced inorganic chemistry, you can. You can actually build three-dimensional representations of molecules ‚Ä¶ The learning tends to happen faster. They go on to the real situation faster.‚Äù (D‚ÄôAgostino, 2022, para. 5).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Side point: Learning Chemistry in Three Dimensions</h2>
<p>Since this is my publishing space, I am going to spend some time on Mushinah Morris‚Äô instructional and learning point here. Again, I was involved in the online teaching of chemistry for 14 years and my research speciality was science in VR, so I‚Äôve got thoughts. If you would like to see her talk on video on this, she‚Äôs in <a href="https://youtu.be/F3bQ4Aw3Vis?si=JuJ4QvIQS9X5USCJ&amp;t=70" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this VictoryXR video</a>.<br><br>She is correct that molecules cannot currently be seen in everyday life. It makes chemistry, as a field, a more abstract or conceptual field (along with physics) when compared to the ‚Äúyou can see it before you‚Äù fields of biology or earth science. Teaching that something unseen exists and engages in reactions has always been the uphill battle of chemistry teachers. So she‚Äôs describing an accurate problem. <br><br>There is a tiny fly in the ointment, however, in that not many students at the college level fall into a chemistry course completely unfamiliar with chemistry at all. So learners in college chemistry probably were exposed to atoms in some other prior learning experience, be it high school, a museum, or a summer-camp like situation. So do her students need to learn atoms from the very beginning? I somewhat doubt that.¬†</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">HCHE Advanced Inorganic Chemistry</h3>
<p>To massively further complicate her argument, she names and shows her chemistry course ‚ÄúAdvanced Inorganic Chemistry‚Äù. That‚Äôs HCHE 421 at Morehouse University, which in 2021 had a prerequisite: <br><br>HCHE 322 Elementary Physical Chemistry,</p>
<p>which itself has 3 prerequisites: <br><br>CHE 321/321L, Elementary Physical Chemistry and Lab (which has 4 prereqs: CHE 232, PHY 154, and MTH 161 and 162)<br><br>PHY 253 Electricity &amp; Magnetism, which has 2 prerequisites: PHY 154 (C or better) and MTH 162<br><br>MTH 271 Introduction to Linear Algebra, which has 1 prerequisite: MTH 161 <br><br>You see where I‚Äôm going here.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs highly doubtful that students arriving in an advanced chemistry class after what is <i>years at college</i>, whose content focus is actually math (that‚Äôs what inorganic focuses on) and not spatial abilities (which arguably organic chemistry DOES focus on) have a substantial problem with visualizing atoms and molecules to the point where it is disturbing their learning performance. And therefore VR could make a difference. No. Not buying it.¬†</p>

<p><br>Nonetheless, I‚Äôve known very smart people have trouble visualizing atoms. So it IS remotely possible and let‚Äôs pretend she is articulating only the beginning of the trouble of understanding for a lay crowd‚Ä¶not the only problem. Said another way, she's speaking about VR's affordances overall, maybe not specifically for her students in her aforementioned class. For example, some chemical reactions are easy to understand (like cooking) and some are difficult to understand (like how hair coloring works or cell electrical potentials).<br><br>It is interesting that she said ‚ÄúThe learning tends to happen faster.‚Äù It‚Äôs a couched statement, for sure, with the word ‚Äútends‚Äù. In science that cannot be pinned down. So she gave herself an out. But what was she describing? At this point, we have to think about the instruction of chemistry.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">How To Show Atoms and Molecules</h3>
<p>Within the history of chemistry itself is the continuing saga of how will atoms be depicted? As in, how do you draw them? How are they really? And how does a teacher relay that ‚Äòrealness‚Äô to the learners‚Äì and why?¬†</p>
<p>So we‚Äôve had our:</p>
<p>Atoms are indivisible tiny units, folks. <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Chemistry_for_Changing_Times_(Hill_and_McCreary)/02%3A_Atoms/2.01%3A_Atoms_-_Ideas_from_the_Ancient_Greeks">Thank you to the Greeks</a>! There are no pictures from that time.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve had Bohr‚Äôs heliocentric-like model folks wherein the atom looks like a solar system or set of concentric rings. To be fair, the heliocentric model really does help explain things like electron energy levels.</p>
<p>¬†</p>

<p><br>We‚Äôve had our Thomson plum pudding folks‚Äì which never translated from its culture. Which is probably a shame. I like plums.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVgn22KNTjuudLWm0L9MzuJ2O26K_9SY8GYDN4PSoeIUlztvF0e8jD3sUXDpcvqYQuJpel4RGOULljzOIaJUBE28xAdP37IVYbppmCrOC5ZmHL8xw7y9-dVRnZRHnos049QjKMsUOxHuSe8Rr1opzXbOJyq4mwbY7eFrLOoROqUAvX3GZt66KMrIU5mz4/w320-h117/plum%20pudding%20model.png" border="0" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Thompson's plum pudding atomic model.</figcaption></figure>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>We‚Äôve had our ‚Äòcloud model‚Äô folks - which are like the postmodern philosophers of chemistry. Truth for me, truth for you, we all get a truth. Which isn‚Äôt <em>actually</em> true. But they told us that electrons cannot be pinned down and measured, they could be anywhere at any time but when we set about measuring them, that‚Äôs when they run away from us. Yes, I‚Äôm nodding to Heisenberg here. And wave/particle theory.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibpJhvPiUq6dUB_5YtuQDvewBFwmWmaatUZaeCm_LDXSJ_9RcU3HZQ_19lsf70Yt8fO3wV00L0I7h7qcjsLcv3OGEp3WBeZBiUBDa-Pgyq7QVJZ3ccIS_czFNctafILtLeceAvTO2smQ3tsxJoMJAO8EaXdjiHR3s7Lq6ITOXF3eRsw02pa0lMiyV6Boo/w320-h133/Screenshot%202024-11-11%20095220.png" alt="Cloud model of what an atom looks like." width="320" height="133" border="0" data-original-height="285" data-original-width="685" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Cloud model of what an atom looks like.</figcaption></figure>
<p>After the heliocentric model, however, depictions of atoms needed to be displayed as three-dimensional, not just as two-dimensional on flat paper. By far, I‚Äôve only selected some of the atomic model theories here. If you want to know more, study chemistry! It‚Äôs not hard.<br><br>But, now, going against Mushinah Morris‚Äô arguments now, educators HAVE been working on that educational problem for years (with success, mind you).</p>
<p>First of all, delightful molecular (and atom) kits exist with physical manipulatives. Yeah, they look like tinker toys.¬† I love them. They are good for at least 30 minutes of instruction, maybe more. They are usually plastic (boo, although there is nothing stopping them from being made of wood) and the kits would have to be purchased, stored, and de-germed from time to time. So they have their minor downsides.</p>
<p>Second of all, 2D screens can show 3D objects‚Ä¶that‚Äôs entirely possible.</p>
<p>Third, programming VR to follow mathematical principles ‚Äì like, voila, chemistry DOES!-- is actually not that hard. The first uses of VR in education that I know of were in the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù---that is mathematical sciences, physics and chemistry. Let‚Äôs face it. A computer understands 9.8 meters per second per second MUCH easier than a person does. (&lt;- that‚Äôs one gravitational force).<br><br><br>And get this, purchasing a simulation to teach atoms is so drop-dead cheap that it‚Äôs actually <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">free </a>by now. I have recommended those simulations for courses before and seen learning scores do quite well, thank you.¬†</p>

<p><br>I seriously bet that if I had been able to place that counter proposal before her administrators, I‚Äôd win the budget proposal. Ha! Bonus points that I could prove that my students would score equal to her VR students on the final exam.<br><br>So in all, did she make a good point here? I‚Äôd say no but that‚Äôs because I recognize the instructional problem and I realize that the problem can be solved in a much cheaper and equally as efficient way. Also, she showed no data that ‚Äúthe learners learned faster‚Äù.<br><br>Side point to the side point: Mushinah Morris on YouTube is highly associated with VictoryXR, the vendor that she is using when referring to her VR-for-education accomplishments. Close association with XR vendors makes for suspicious conclusions. I'm not picking on Mushinah Morris unfairly. She's gone on the record multiple times for her claims. I could easily pick (and will in the future) other education influencers that are selling the VR-for-education snake oil.<br><br>Back to my article<br><br><br>Further, there is at least one study (so far!) that refutes this focusing-causes-faster-learning claim. Makransky, Terkildsen, et al. (2019) found that immersive metaverse environments could be sensory overload for learners and therefore decrease the learner‚Äôs focus. On the whole, claims for increased speed can often be attributed to more efficient instructional methods. Immersive experiences can allow for the utilization of comparatively faster instructional methods.<br><br>The author finds this myth, that immersive experiences cause learners to learn faster, false.¬†</p>

                <p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">I write this title with a tinge of irony. I‚Äôve owned virtual campuses. I‚Äôve worked on virtual campuses. If asked to work on a virtual campus again, I‚Äôd likely say yes.¬† So what‚Äôs my beef with virtual campuses? </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">I feel that a sober-eyed look at virtual campuses* is necessary.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Following the philosophy of ‚Äúthose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it‚Äù (Santayana), here is Part 3 of my series: From Myths to Principles; Navigating Instructional Design in Immersive Environments.</span></p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The rise and fall of the metaversity</span></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">In <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-immersive-environment-delusion-part.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 2</a> of this series,I examined two examples from the history of immersive learning. First, I showed the parallels when companies like Meta and Linden Lab dominate a single platform for immersive learning designs. The lesson is that what is allowed one day can quickly become disallowed the next day. Second, I pointed out the inappropriate boasting and poor course design used in the ‚Äúfirst course in virtual reality‚Äù by Stanford University. In these recent cases (Meta and Stanford University) there was a remarkable lack of awareness of the history of immersive learning. Said another way, mistakes of the past were repeated.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">In another example of history repeating itself, ten colleges and universities adopted digital twin campuses in June 2022 using the ENGAGE platform with monetary support and donated VR headsets from Meta (Koenig, 2022). These metaversity locations recreated (or <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://sway.cloud.microsoft/RyZEZBkthFHDhku7?ref=Link" rel="noopener noreferrer">created</a>!) campus buildings to allow learners to gather on the virtual campus.¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eight years prior, Second Life (SL) campus buildings were ‚Äúdesigned to mimic real-world architectural equivalents‚Äù but had become ‚Äúabandoned ghost towns‚Äù (Wecker, 2014).¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">The early Second Life virtual campus creations were often the result of student projects. Confusingly, the professors who designed and assigned these projects touted the work of creating faithful campus recreations as <i>creative</i> and thus, at the highest level of Bloom‚Äôs cognitive learning objectives. I‚Äôm inserting a heavy eye roll here because that‚Äôs really stretching the justification of working in virtual reality to an extreme point.¬† Plus, I have to point out: what does next year‚Äôs class build if this year‚Äôs class made the campus?¬† My point is that simply building campus buildings (so that you can have a virtual campus!) is a project idea that runs out of steam. Things got really interesting right after the SL virtual campuses were launched.¬† Everyone involved noticed that the spaces were not being utilized.¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">¬†</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Students were asked why they weren't visiting the virtual campus.¬† </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">The answer was simple.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">No one was there. </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">You see, you could have the most amazing design with all of the bells and whistles (really!), but if people were not there, then people found that there was no compelling reason to return. Admissions folks had no compelling reason to be in the virtual admissions building, same for financial aid teams. Even library teams today in virtual reality struggle to staff spaces with the same spread as IRL (in real life) libraries.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">During a recent tour of the University of Maryland Global Campus metaversity campus, the audio connection failed. The host did not offer any tech support. The experience showcased empty buildings during what was a busy time of the academic semester. To be fair, I understand the implications of FERPA which might have predicted that students were in classroom spaces separate from public spaces. However, it is logical that on any campus, students could still be found¬† in public space buildings like the networking lounge. These accurate campus recreations rarely spur more than a passing interest to learners.¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph is-empty" aria-label="Write here. You can also include @mentions."><span style="font-family: arial;">¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">The ten colleges and universities in this project are now facing the end of the project and the initial funding is ending. Steven Van Hook commented that, ‚ÄúAdministrators may speak of their twin campuses in glittering terms on the record ‚Äìthen off the record talk about their regrets and what else they could have bought for the hundreds of thousands of dollars‚Äù (VWBPE, 2024). According to Temple University‚Äôs Kathy Hirsh Pasek, ‚ÄúA year ago, a lot of companies were going full steam ahead. Today‚Äôs that‚Äôs not true; they‚Äôve rerouted a lot of their funds for AI and Twitter alternatives‚Äù (Coffey, 2023, para. 37) Institutions made the decision to adopt immersive experiences but do not appear to know how to make wise decisions when generous funding stops and societal attention moves on.</span></p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The key problems</span></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, throughout these first three parts of this series, there are several challenges apparent. Instructional designers and administrators must wade through the myriad of claims derived from dubious research studies. It feels like chicanery to figure out which statements about immersive experiences for learning are authentic and do point the way to future positive outcomes and which statements are in doubt. The first issue is with interpreting research wisely. Every research study has inherent flaws; no one study can definitively provide answers to all of education‚Äôs questions. This situation is made worse when the research is translated into social media and seems to tout incredible claims (Lanier et al., 2019).</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, the conundrum has been illuminated. The myths that appear to come from a research basis must be dispelled. Next, the very basis of the published research record is at risk of bias and problems. This series will inform on what characteristics to look for in published research.¬† Finally, if one were to step around the research interpretation problems, what is the system for building and using immersive experiences for its best advantage? This series will attempt to answer these questions. This series then forms the navigator role for instructional designers and administrators figuring out how to chart a route to a successful implementation. </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__heading"><span style="font-family: arial;">Post Script</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">*virtual campuses </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">I‚Äôm using the term virtual campuses to specifically refer to real world recreations of campus spaces like quads and lecture halls. I am not referring to simulations (for example in science courses) or spaces specifically designed for social use (for example, dance halls). </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Virtual campuses were designed as early as 1999 as text-based educational MUVEs (multi user virtual environments). This example classroom shows ‚Äúthe room‚Äôs description, list of contents, who¬† is in the room, the exits, and links to applications‚Äù (Maher, et al., 1999).</span></p>

<div id="docs-internal-guid-195a7ea9-7fff-f06d-26c5-8b3e4fa397e0" style="line-height: 1.56; margin-bottom: 2pt; margin-top: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The history of educational technology is a rhyme that repeats. Initial pitches have created optimism that the next big thing in technology will revolutionize education. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/07/the-computer-delusion/376899/">Oppenheimer</a> (1997) in a really well written article illustrated part of the history of educational technology by citing four examples:</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Edison‚Äôs 1922 prediction that the motion picture will revolutionize education.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Levenson‚Äôs claim that radios will become common in every classroom.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Skinner asserted that learners with teaching machines could learn twice as much.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Clinton campaigned that computers are a bridge to the twenty-first century. (para. 1)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The motion picture, the radio receiver, programmed instruction, and computers in the classroom have all failed to significantly impact learner performance. The past 102 years have not been kind to hyped educational technology predictions.</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: left;">I can hear you through the nether. <br>There are some saying "But the metaverse is different!" <br>Sit down. üëàüò†<br>I'll deal with you soon enough.</div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>Cuban (1986) further suggested that this educational technology adoption cycle follows a predictable pattern. First, the earliest research will be produced by the technology producers themselves. Second, problems arise with adoption. Learner performance does not improve over the long term. The final stage in the cycle is blame-finding with reasons ranging from not enough money, educator resistance, and educational systems resistant to change. The methods and reasoning for incorporating the technology are rarely addressed in the historical or market record. The reader of this series might recognize these statements already being made about immersive experiences. As such, hype cycles for immersive experiences are already underway.<br>¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This last point deserves emphasis. Here are the steps again:</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>1. Tech producers make the first "research".<br>2. Tech adopted, but learner performance does not improve long term.<br>3. Blame-finding ensues.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>I wanted to emphasize these points because they are going to appear in the research record that I will present. </span></div>
<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-195a7ea9-7fff-f06d-26c5-8b3e4fa397e0" style="line-height: 1.56; margin-bottom: 2pt; margin-top: 12pt; text-align: left;"></h1>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Immersive experiences have already weathered several boom and bust cycles. One cycle began between 2003 and 2009. The desktop-based virtual reality program called Second Life, created by Linden Lab, attracted over 100 universities (Brown &amp; Sugar, 2009) and thousands of dollars of investment (Wecker, 2014).<br><br>In a sudden decision, Linden Lab eliminated its 50% discount for educational institutions (Harrison, 2010). What resulted was an educator exodus and fracture in the faith of immersive experiences for education. When referring to the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/woodbury-u-banned-from-second-life-again">shutdown of Woodbury University‚Äôs virtual campus</a> for breach of conduct, Jordan Bellino, a senior learner at the institution, described the hazard when one major company dominates use:<br><br>The incident suggests the dangers of online meeting spaces‚Äô being run by companies, which get to decide who participates and who doesn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúIt took years and thousands of dollars to make that virtual campus happen,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand it all vanished in a matter of an hour because Linden Lab pushed a button.‚Äù (Young, 2010, para. 12)<br><br>Major technology companies can single-handedly dictate use of immersive environments. This would be a valuable lesson lost before the next boom cycle began in 2018.</span></p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>After the launch of the consumer-oriented Quest headsets and the mandate for remote learning due to the COVID pandemic in 2020, interest in immersive environments surged. In June of 2021, Stanford opened their Virtual People course to 263 learners (Bailenson, 2021).¬†</span></div>

</a></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">¬†</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The course was touted to be the first class in the world to be held inside of virtual reality (Hadhazy, 2021) which seemed to cast aside the nearly two-decade deep body of research on courses held as immersive experiences. The prestige of the course was further hyped when one of the course professors boasted:</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">I can now stand up in front of all my students and there's, you know, two hundred in the class, and I can say you will actually have a better chance of getting a job in the Valley because of taking this class because as of about a year ago, the most sought-after job in the Valley went from a data scientist to a VR engineer. (<a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/education/stanford-virtual-reality-class-puts-students-in-metaverse">Bellini,</a> 2024, para 12)</span></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>The VR-based learning resulted in greater presence, enjoyment, motivation, and transfer (Han &amp; Bailenson, 2024). However, within the course, all was not well. Video clips from the class showed learners struggling to control their avatars (Bailenson, 2021) and attending class just to stand around in circles (Bellini, 2021).</span></div>
<div>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gOLI_OIV3nc?si=jv2LF-d4Dz8sIZsf" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>In spite of the boasting, published reports illuminated problems with onboarding learners to the VR headset experience, unexpected software updates, and sudden platform shutdowns (Han &amp; Bailenson, 2024).¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>The instructional design was described as <strong><i>learning by doing</i></strong>, but the syllabus showed a majority of outside-of-virtual-world writing and quiz items. Within the immersive environment, there were required weekly discussion sessions (Han et al., 2022) and one project where learners could import 3D (three-dimensional) objects to make a unique VR environment. My translation? That's not much doing, actually, as it relates to being a "virtual person".¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Much to the professors‚Äô astonishment, one group of learners made a mock fake moon landing production set (Brown et al., 2023). For the course instructors, this suddenly raised the specter that immersive experiences can create false depictions or fake memories, a topic that will be revisited in the ethical labyrinths section of this series.</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">In Part 3, I'll share another example of boom and bust from the immersive environments-for-education market.<br><br></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Post-publication edit:</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>They say there is no editor like the "Publish" button and that makes me laugh because you DO spot errors after something has been published.¬† But in this case, it's not an error that I want to address, I want to add more depth and context to this post. Since it's my blog, I can. This work was previously planned to be a book chapter and as such, I held my tongue on some of my more pointed criticism and images. But here, I can lay out things more directly.<br></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Directly I am pointing to the </span>Communication 166/266:<span style="font-family: helvetica;">Virtual People course as a poor design from an instructional designer's point of view. I have studied the syllabus and read several articles and watched videos produced about the course.¬† You can read <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/downloads/comm166" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the syllabus yourself!</a></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>What I can't find is how many credits the course was. Just guessing from the workload in the syllabus, I'd guess 2 credits.¬† Could be 3 but it also could be 1. I severely doubt it's 4. <br><br>Where do I get the platform to critique this course?<br><br>1. I have 14 years full time experience teaching online. Until ~2034, there are very few that can match me with that kind of full time online teaching experience. Bailenson's class was arguably not "online" by definition (it happened in June 2021 or so and that would be post-shutdown), but it appears to have happened entirely remotely with the exception of picking up the headsets. So I can claim some expertise about what SHOULD happen with digital-based, if not online, instruction.<br>2. My doctorate is in Instructional Design specifically *for Online Learning*. So I've spent my time focusing on that.<br>3. My research focus was and is learning in immersive environments (hence this article series).<br>4. Uniquely, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-taught-one-earths-first-courses-oculus-quest-2-heather-dodds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I ALSO taught a course using the Meta Quest 2s</a> which had a similar "survey" type of design. So what Bailenson did by visiting topics each week briefly is NOT part of my critique.<br><br>Three things are my main concerns here:</span></p>
<h4 style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br><strong>1. Video clips show a ridiculous amount of on-boarding malarkey.¬†</strong> </span></h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Said another way, bringing learners into a 3D environment, not acclimating them to this and then bringing in various models and just letting the users play is nice for an introduction. It does NOT make a course and certainly it does not argue for a widespread use of the technology.<br><br>I'm sure that in one version of the video, I could hear learners over and over again gathered in small groups supposedly "doing" something in VR only to hear "can anyone hear me?" as a COMMON statement. Take my word for it; a class filled <i>from beginning to end</i> with learners not being able to hear or be heard does not count for much learning.<br></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">My point: there isn't evidence that anything other than some "visits" to VR happened.¬† And yet, over and over, this flagship course (my phrase) has learners that can't walk, can't wave, cannot follow instructions and (I guess) can't hear instructions. After week one, the learners *should* be on-boarded, all practiced up and ready to do harder things. 'Just walk over here for a group photo' should not feel like a nearly impossible task-- but the videos sure do make it look like it was.¬† <br><br>I had to giggle üòÑ because in that "all class" photo, there is one avatar in 2D, not in a headset, because they don't have hands and their movement is all 2D-type, and they are the only one that looks "logical" in their behaviors.<br><br>2.<strong> Bailenson really shows his excitement¬† </strong></span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">(in the somewhat unprofessional video) <strong>but also the "un-put-togetherness" of this experience </strong>with the his statement: <br><br></span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">I can now stand up in front of all my students and there's, you know, two hundred in the class, and I can say you will actually have a better chance of getting a job in the Valley because of taking this class because as of about a year ago, the most sought-after job in the Valley went from a data scientist to a VR engineer.

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>I find it VERY hard to believe that this one course at the 100 and 200 level will lead to 200 new VR engineer's getting jobs in "the Valley".¬† Insert hard eyeroll here. üôÑ¬† It looks extra bravado-y when he phrases it as "I can now stand up" as if he's really planning to do this or HAS done it.¬† It's a brag.¬† No humble about it.¬† Last I checked, the Valley wants to hire computer scientists, who should be in calculus class at the same time as this headset romp. Fact check: The Valley has been laying off VR teams.¬† So how's that 'better chance of getting a job' brag going for ya?<br><br>3. <strong>The learn-by-doing quote gets under my skin </strong>as an instructional designer. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Learn WHAT by doing WHAT, in this case? His students had to use pre-existing 3D models included in the ENGAGE platform (OK, fine-- but note that I didn't see ANY examples of models beyond ones we've already seen in ENGAGE advertising) to build a scene that was basically their final project.¬†</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">(Again, disclosure: my students final project was a video mock-up of an immersive experience that they would design, if they could. The course taught no programming skills.)¬†</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">So OK, it's fine that learners can't program after 1 course. Totally understood. But then the learners put together a final project scene that sounds like Bailenson's team spit out their coffee over...J. Brown source described the team experience as, "jarring" and wanted to coin a new phrase, "mis-experience."¬† What the phrase? Garbage in, garbage out?¬† You don't design a compelling course and the results surprise you?¬† Sigh.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">It appears that they took the "made lemonade from lemons" approach. Note that I haven't mentioned ANYTHING about comparative learning outcomes related to this heralded course. Because there isn't any data on that. Not like there should be, but the research is remarkably silent ü§´ on that. <br><br>Also fact check on this: the Meta Quest 2 headsets are officially OUT of support and sale from Meta. So they are, as of this writing, outdated. I wonder how it's going over there at Stanford. Do they just ring up Mark and ask for 266 more headsets in the Meta Quest 3 type now?<br><br>I haven't mentioned, (actually I left it OUT), how much ENGAGE got free advertising from this mess. That's because they are really the main characters in the NEXT episode.<br><br></span></p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This article begins a new series where I intend to continue to bust myths related to learning in immersive environments while also advocating for research-based decisions related to instructional design.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>Now if that sounded like gobbly-gook, this might not be the series for you. But, for anyone with an interest in virtual worlds, the metaverse, or even a simple 2D simulation and the uses of these for education, this is the RIGHT place for you. <br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This is an updated version of my original 8-part Instructional Design in the Metaverse series. (Did you miss that? Here's my <a href="https://youtu.be/Rr4dzKLPlpQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 minute explainer video</a>.) I estimate that I have at least 15 parts right now to start this series and new research comes in every day. However, t</span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">his being my blog, I intend to spill a little more tea here than I do in other places.</span><br><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>Buckle up buttercups</span>!<hr></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>A wondrous thing happens the first time a learner steps into the metaverse; the learner enters a land of digital imagination. The immersive technology creates and presents what the learner senses visually and auditorily. Because those experiences are digital creations, the possibilities can be as varied and broad as human imagination. This wide open promise of anything anywhere has attracted educators and researchers for more than two decades. Within the body of research generated from this attraction, significant challenges remain for those interested in the prudent application of the immersive learning design.<br><br>The global virtual reality (VR) industry is forecast to reach $435 billion in United States dollars within the next 6 years, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 27% (Yahoo Finance, 2023). Immersive or extended reality (XR) technologies are broad combinations of computer technology that overlays or fully surround the learner with digitally constructed sights, sounds, smell, taste, pressure, heat, and texture sensations (Ziker et al., 2021). XR as a broad term is understood to encompass virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). Immersive experiences stand distinct as an educational media choice due to the factors of immersion, embodiment, and presence that arise within the learner (Southgate, 2020). This series will use the term immersive experiences to refer to the inclusive concept of learning within virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, cross reality, transmedia, and the metaverse. <br><br>Immersive experiences are expected to expand within the next few years in the areas of education, industrial training, and healthcare where the influence of instructional design could be beneficial. Educators have already been turning to immersive experiences for uses such as simulation, training, providing access to limited resources and to bridge distances as a form of remote learning (Kavanaugh et al., 2017). New educators and designers, however, often express a sense of being overwhelmed at the idea of designing instruction that would essentially be spherical (as in, surrounding the learner) and containing infinite potential (immersive experiences could contain any information or process). Unquestioningly, everyone feels that the design work is complex. <br><br>Regardless, there are still educators who, despite sudden platform shutdowns and expensive contracts, feel that immersive experiences have 'enormous unrealized potential‚Äô (Wecker, 2014). The complexity of designing for the metaverse calls for assistance from instructional design that focuses on ‚Äúinstructional methods, specific features that facilitate actual learning‚Äù (Honebein &amp; Reigeluth, 2023. p. 292). Unfortunately, heretofore immersive experiences have precipitated haphazard designs lacking guidance:<br><br></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Education researchers borrow heavily from the entertainment designers, who focus on engagement, and not necessarily on retention of content. The dearth of studies highlights the urgency for a set of guidelines for designing content that allows users to make appropriate choices in a spherical space. (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018, p. 7)</span></p>

</a></div>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Therefore, this series will begin with looking at the current state of immersive experiences for learning research. Published research however, often falls short of the mark. This series will contribute to both fundamental and practical applications (Shi &amp; Evans, 2023), landing in Pasteur‚Äôs Quadrant as Mayer (2020) suggested, as ‚Äúbasic research in applied situations‚Äù (p. 22). This series draws from the body of published research in the form of a selective consumer; it discriminates seeking to understand the wise applications of immersive environments. Additionally, it addresses real problems faced by instructional designers and administrators. Staying grounded in reality will be very important as we journey into the research of virtual worlds.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">We will begin with some history, next post.</span></p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">So what are the characteristics that predict success for an educational experience? Read on.</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading">Characteristics of Success</h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">By the time IDs are often introduced to learning projects, the decision to incorporate XR technologies might already be made. Yet, IDs might be tasked with evaluating choices for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FcHXvL2SmWqNwnLpmc-0Ti2N6tQotVseBYWSjL39P2w/edit#heading=h.nnsa5urx8jnn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">off-the-shelf XR experiences</a> or do-it-yourself (DIY) projects. Both choices have possibilities and limits and this part will point out what characteristics predict that an XR solution should work for a given implementation.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">IDs should complete a thorough market analysis for off-the-shelf experiences. However, learning standards and ratings have not moved from early research to implementation (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lana-Dreimane/publication/338676708_Virtual_Reality_Learning_Experience_Evaluation_Tool_for_Instructional_Designers_and_Educators/links/613f19b8e4419c5e6ec9d8eb/Virtual-Reality-Learning-Experience-Evaluation-Tool-for-Instructional-Designers-and-Educators.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreimane</a>, 2020). Thus, the experiences vary in quality with some being quite poor.</p>

<div>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">On the other hand, <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-taught-one-earths-first-courses-oculus-quest-2-heather-dodds" rel="noopener noreferrer">XR experiences not tagged as educational can be successfully used for learning</a> with careful implementation.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In a DIY project, IDs could be asked to learn 3D programming, such as Unity or Unreal. Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to be used for 3D development and this could assist IDs. If IDs do engage primarily in programming and building assets, there is a risk that they will take their eyes off the goal of representing the learner. An ID should be constantly asking the question,‚Äúwhat is the learner experiencing?‚Äù and making sure that all decisions align to the planned purpose.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In general, the research up to this point indicates these three characteristics predict a successful XR educational experience:</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">While having one of these characteristics is good for continuing development, having two or all three characteristics can lead to very successful full implementation. For example, an XR experience for wind turbine maintenance training would currently save time, money, and danger.</p>

<h2 class="article-editor-content__paragraph" style="text-align: left;"><strong>It Saves or Manipulates Time</strong></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">XR experiences can manipulate time for instruction. For instance, an experience could involve time travel, speeding up, slowing down, or pausing time.¬†</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">[Editor Heather interjects: the River City Multi User Virtual Environment (MUVE) is a great example of <strong>time manipulation</strong>. Learners had to determine the cause of 3 diseases in a city on a river. This built pedagogically went where learners often struggle: determining cause in a multi-variable (READ: real world, messy, wicked) system. The build could pause or speed up time--very helpful while waiting for bacteria to grow.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">XR experiences can also reduce instructional time overall because the training can be delivered more efficiently to the learners. For example, workplace training that has been preloaded onto VR headsets can be shipped to remote workers, saving travel time.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">IDs should be aware that with this characteristic, <strong><i>many 2D simulations can do the same</i></strong> time manipulation and savings<strong><i> for possibly lower costs</i></strong>.</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__paragraph" style="text-align: left;"><strong>It Saves Money</strong></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">XR experiences can save money over other forms of learning. For example, it would cost a lot of money to take your learners to the Moon in real life. In XR, space travel is much cheaper.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh61GzuLeZd1EZi-VcsGR5PJ8RbFLeRZkZKshWjwI8AhO6dssjyflceln7JTjfGi5kYkL54AKTvujtyiUVe8ZyheFh4MulB-Q34_8IoxuozlGeHCpOwkS_rmqLcj6anMEuwwysY2aCWSivQUzCNyTJzE8ddCIWYyYpVc_z9o4wpLCAHtGG1OFyTZtcGHk4/w640-h340/Mission%20ISS.png" width="640" height="340" border="0" data-original-height="694" data-original-width="1309" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Capture from Mission: ISS.

Those unfamiliar with development trends might comment that the metaverse is not currently cheaper than other media. As of this writing, costs are dropping [Editor Heather reminds you that 1 of the 2 things<i> </i><a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/virtual-reality-soft-skillsmaybe-heather-dodds/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>I actually liked</i> about the PwC study was the calculation</a> that if you make a build for more than 3,000 users, it will be cheaper overall to do in XR versus e-learning] with the arrival of artificial-intelligence (AI) developed resources.¬†
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Immersive web (WebXR) options allow approximately 20 learners to join one virtual space with a web browser, no additional equipment. Development prices do rise with more complexity.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">One final note: the ‚Äòtime is money‚Äô statement does hold true here. Often, an XR experience that saves time also saves money.¬†¬†</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__paragraph" style="text-align: left;"><strong>It Reduces Danger</strong></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This characteristic, the metaverse reduces danger, also includes impossible activities. While <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://aperturesciencellc.com/vr/VisualDesignMethodsforVR_MikeAlger.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alger </a>(2015) properly suggested that any content that was inherently 3D in the first place is ideal for XR development, XR is not limited to the real and actual. It can expand to the phantasmagorical and impossible. For instance, taking learners to look inside of an operating nuclear reactor would be dangerous in real life. This can be replicated in XR with no added danger for the learners.¬†</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFfCSbWFJnh8Y9HZI_2jZ4xfKuyCRY9LIjUh7RemUQbTdL9z4v57gueKAN_FPuDGNOgycuW4l00r2CMQe1BqnvwTlv65dVAcGa5geQ7uwlfsfRl04Uh5qNKmV_HY_qKl407D4_MpgtZdBB6T_T0NIJ3cYvaNWj62Ulrjhgr8xfwyUjyIbT0pvGNTQm0Pk/w640-h360/VR%20Nuclear%20Reactor.png" width="640" height="360" border="0" data-original-height="540" data-original-width="960" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>How a nuclear reactor generates electricity. Don't try this at home unless you are in VR.</figcaption></figure>
<br>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">IDs should remember that some environments in the metaverse can still represent psychological risk if not real danger. In the Proteus Effect, learners could change their behavior depending on what their avatar is experiencing (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Goerlich/publication/347582766_How_Avatars_Influence_User_Behavior_A_Review_on_the_Proteus_Effect_in_Virtual_Environments_and_Video_Games/links/624997f421077329f2eec0f7/How-Avatars-Influence-User-Behavior-A-Review-on-the-Proteus-Effect-in-Virtual-Environments-and-Video-Games.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Praetorius, &amp; G√∂rlich</a>, 2020). As a result, a learner‚Äôs avatar walking into fire might be a frightening experience even if it is physically safe. Examples of risks include claustrophobia, fear of heights, hostility, prejudices, and negative social pressures.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In all cases, IDs should keep the learner primarily in mind. If it scares a learner <i>and it was not meant to</i>, it should be removed from the design.</p>
<hr>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Let's take a short pause here-- we're about halfway through these articles and let's propose some questions.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Question:</strong> I know of some educational experiences that were VERY expensive to build, they cost a lot now, and they work great. Your formula would NOT necessarily predict their success.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Answer:</strong> The 'saving money' part is <strong>compared to the real world</strong>. So while I respect that some experiences are VERY expensive, I'm happy they work great. I just bet they are a LOT cheaper in XR than doing whatever it is in real life.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Q:</strong> <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://youtu.be/GOYrC1hH6Ak?si=6ez3Q6OAgkGLqybb" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Bailenson has his DICE formula</a>: <strong>D</strong>angerous,<strong> I</strong>mpossible, <strong>C</strong>ounterproductive, and <strong>E</strong>xpensive. Why should we remember your shorter "time, money, danger" version instead?</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> With all respect to Jeremy, he has a lot of advantages at getting his message out (white, male, Stanford, and so on). But I developed my list -- as best as I can tell-- simultaneously to his (my 1st publication on it is 2013). So I'm claiming <strong>co-evolution</strong> because I believe we were looking at the same pile of research up to that time. What I don't like about his list (even though yes, he's got an acronym and I don't) is that his list is counterintuitive to understand. The 4 conditions he lists are <strong>what should be present in the real world <i>to then consider using VR</i></strong>. They are not 'when you should use VR'--- because if they were, how would "counterproductive" make sense? BTW, if you don't understand his use of counterproductive, watch the video I linked to his name above.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Q:</strong> But you don't have Impossible on your list?</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> I subsume the impossible inside the dangerous. Cause it is <i>really</i> dangerous to do the impossible. üòâ</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Q:</strong> OK, last question. What if an experience does not save time, does not save money, and isn't less dangerous (relatively) than the real thing?</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Besides realizing that Parts 1-3 basically advised against even thinking to make that experience, I say "even a broken clock is right twice a day." There is always a chance, however low. These 3 guidelines are based on years of watching experiences rise and fall. Odd, surprising builds still happen and more luck to them.</p>
<blockquote class="article-editor-content__blockquote">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">I've seen more success that I can chalk up to <strong>the people present </strong> <strong>than the tech present</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading">Myths versus Reality</h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The metaverse in education is an emerging topic and a potentially lucrative field, possibly set to supplant learning management systems as the next industry-wide educational platform (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://arpost.co/2023/02/10/extended-reality-learning-potential/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spilka</a>, 2023). Improvements in technology are fostering an ‚Äúanytime at anywhere‚Äù implementation of the metaverse (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40561-022-00205-x" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tlili, Huang, Shehata, et al.</a>, 2022, p. 4). As interest in the metaverse as educational media has increased, misleading claims or myths have already circulated. These myths are often shrouded under the title of research until the curious probe a little deeper. This part will examine claims such as the metaverse will cause learners to learn more and faster, it represents active learning and is therefore better, it is more immersive than ever, learners retain more, it increases empathy, and learners like it so therefore they learn better. This section will mention areas where the research is still unknown, publishing bias, and what to look for when IDs read educational research on the metaverse.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Learners in the metaverse will learn more and faster; this is the first claim examined. IDs should maintain a healthy skepticism of claims that a certain media causes dramatic learning improvements. Claims often do not communicate instructional methods as <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leonel-Morgado/publication/368434277_Educational_Practices_and_Strategies_with_Immersive_Learning_Environments_Mapping_of_Reviews_for_using_the_Metaverse/links/63ffc7680cf1030a5661703e/Educational-Practices-and-Strategies-with-Immersive-Learning-Environments-Mapping-of-Reviews-for-using-the-Metaverse.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beck, Morgado, and O‚ÄôShea (2023</a>) pointed out. Instead, current publishing focuses on outcomes-based research or what <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles-Reigeluth/publication/371304955_How_Do_We_Solve_a_Problem_Like_Media_and_Methods_207/links/647e04b6b3dfd73b7767f1d2/How-Do-We-Solve-a-Problem-Like-Media-and-Methods-207.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reigeluth and Honebein</a> called research-to-prove results that are ‚Äútypically operationalized by comparing a new medium to a traditional one‚Äù (2023, p. 2). For instance, a lesson in XR could be compared to a lesson in a textbook. Similarly, the <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.17226/24783" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine</a> advised that possible external validity of some studies is low in that ‚Äúthere is considerable evidence that a single instructional technology can lead to different outcomes when used by different learners in different contexts‚Äù (2018, p. 194). These claims usually represent the pitting of two very different instructional methods and thus cognitive workloads against each other.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Here is an example of this claim. In a study incorporating virtual reality (VR) headsets for soft skills training, Scott Likens of PricewaterhouseCoopers claimed, ‚ÄúWe found the realism and performance feedback in virtual reality simulations helped people learn faster and retain more information around soft skills,‚Äù (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/spring2021/pages/virtual-reality-training-spreads-its-wings.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zielinski, 2021</a>, para. 9). However, <strong>the accompanying published report contradicted these claims.</strong> When comparing information retention in VR versus an e-learning course, the authors ‚Äúquickly discovered retention scores were inconclusive, as the delta between pre and post-assessments in each modality was <strong>not significant</strong>‚Äù (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/technology/emerging-technology/assets/pwc-understanding-the-effectiveness-of-soft-skills-training-in-the-enterprise-a-study.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eckert &amp; Mower, 2020</a>, p. 44, emphasis added). Thus, the two different media showed no different learning outcomes.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Another claim is that the isolation effect of a headset causes faster learning, perhaps arguing that less distraction equals more focus. In the same study, Likens stated, ‚ÄúA lot of courses that normally take an hour could be completed in 20 minutes through VR because people are so immersed in scenarios, there are fewer distractions and the learning is very concentrated‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 10). Referring to the same study, ‚ÄúVR was x4 faster than classroom and x1.5 faster than e-learning‚Äù (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PXRJEAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=UpbIsA4SJU&amp;dq=learning%20experience%20design%20Clark&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. Clark, 2022</a>, p. 190). Claims that learning is completed faster attempt to represent XR as a more efficient learning method, i.e., less time to learn equals learning faster. When compared to classroom learning, it is already known that 1:1 personalized learning is faster. In this case, the classroom learning was allotted to two hours and the VR experience took 29 minutes. Given that 29 minutes is approximately one-quarter of two hours, the touted line was that XR was four times (4x) faster. <strong>In fact, the XR media did not cause the learning to be completed faster, it was the 1:1 nature of the learning experience. </strong></p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Lauding the media that manipulated instructional methods hides the fact that the learner could achieve the same results in a different media, given comparable time and resources.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Some claims state that learner-instigated avatar movement, in the form of moving hands, heads, or bodies, or the first-person point of view makes XR learning inherently active as opposed to passive. Intentional avatar movement is associated with manipulating content, which is the term embodiment or embodied learning (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2018.00081" rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnson-Glenberg</a>, 2018; <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02364" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markowitz, Laha, Perone, et al.</a>, 2018). The claim begins with the given that active learning is known to be better than passive learning. Because XR is body-movement active, it must be active learning and thus cause more learning¬† (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018). However, research has shown that while embodiment does have a connection to learning, it does not exclusively <strong><i>cause</i></strong> learning. Truly, ‚Äúplatform is not destiny‚Äù as <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elena-Kalina-2/publication/352059688_Platform_is_not_destiny_Embodied_learning_effects_comparing_2D_desktop_to_3D_virtual_reality_STEM_experiences/links/60fb097e169a1a0103b1e03b/Platform-is-not-destiny-Embodied-learning-effects-comparing-2D-desktop-to-3D-virtual-reality-STEM-experiences.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;_sg%5B1%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;origin=journalDetail" rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnson‚ÄêGlenberg, Bartolomea, &amp; Kalina</a> stated in 2021 (p. 20). <strong>Just putting a learning experience with movement into XR does not make it active learning.</strong></p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3 More Immersion</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">There are some claims that take issue with the second assumption stated earlier in this series: Learning outcomes are expected to be equal to other media (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayer</a>, 2020). These claims state that earlier comparative media studies did not show improved results because the technology then was older. Thus, technology now utilizes a better <i>quality</i> of immersion. This claim reflects a modernist philosophical approach: newer is better. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://stanfordvr.com/mm/2015/cummings-mp-how-immersive.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cummings and Bailenson</a> (2016) reported that head tracking, stereoscopic visuals, and wider fields of view created more immersion than other visual or audio improvements. Yet Mayer wrote in 2020, ‚Äúthese comparisons between low-immersion and high-immersion media <strong>do not provide strong evidence </strong>for the instructional value of converting a 2D lesson rendered on a computer screen into a 3D lesson displayed with a head-mounted display in immersive virtual reality‚Äù (p. 365). Moreover, <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ME.1943-5479.0001101" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abbas, Seoo, Ahn et al</a>. (2023) found that high levels of presence did not impact user behaviors. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frvir.2022.742509/full" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ochs and Sonderegger</a> (2022) reported that learners that felt an increased sense of presence in VR scored worse on measures of memorization even when the learner simultaneously self-reported that they expected to do better in VR versus 2D. Finally, Makransky, Terkildsen, &amp; Mayer found that VR causes more presence but less learning (2019).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Overall, these claims also fail to acknowledge that the main subject in media studies are humans (not the media), and we already know a great deal about how humans learn in 3D environments. These spaces exist outside of technology and are called classrooms. <strong>These claims that newer XR will cause more learning look more like calls to buy the latest technology. </strong></p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">4 Greater Retention</h3>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeVIw4VyaeF_v2Qt3DtcXjB31m0yIv3KMLfmVwFH-QLtHMvrf6FQGo34L2toNRxFYBap_Mkxiyf7DfSvGVY_wB8pADOv6Pf1YTJsVIb7HaxzuUmeYdz-OMTZmLwZMAZzeU0UTCZ-tP1qTL0SbLF6lxnwVbuiDxi5von8E_sibaVh-r5hyphenhyphen5hWuTwTsMUWE/w640-h478/better%20retention.png" alt="Capture of post with text: It has been proven that people learn better through an immersive experience and &quot;retain material better&quot;." width="640" height="478" border="0" data-original-height="784" data-original-width="1050" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Claim: better retention, "it has been proven". <br>Not so much.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This claim states that XR enhances knowledge retention (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://iprjb.org/journals/index.php/IJHR/article/view/2018" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victor</a>, 2023). Studies of retention are still ongoing and difficult to find. Indeed, broad reviews such as those conducted by <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40692-020-00169-2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamilton, McKechnie, Edgerton, and Wilson</a> (2021) commented that finding ‚Äúlearning outcomes, intervention characteristics, and assessment measures associated with immersive virtual reality use has been sparse‚Äù (2021, p. 1). This aligns with Beck, Morgado, and O‚ÄôShea who contended that, ‚ÄúVery few literature reviews focus on the educational practices and strategies used in immersive learning environments. Thus, the problem is that we are evaluating outcomes without a comparable way to describe the educational approaches that led to those outcomes‚Äù (2023, p. 2). Therefore, retention could be achieved with XR implementation, but without more research detail, greater results might be attributable to the method, not the media.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The use of the metaverse in education is not yet common. It is difficult to find studies that measure retention within learners <i>more than</i> 10 to 21 days after instruction. Practical workplace implementation would require much longer retention times. Therefore, <strong>this claim has not yet been supported or refuted</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">5 Increase Empathy</h3>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTiuHUYgPmwx1DRrK2BKH3_FIHYgdJ-sl2sFPhZyqJB8ZjMGLqtgowxJeGCUGcZHLj5mWTY5D2l5Pr_eapfXBUDuffKJXG0PindHmiMZxyVgzV514Br0Asjh2Bq7VYv8ti2fo7KXlxnX7GhbYDC1LpazQbirKS3qE-Rv0Bb2N5CGJoTXiTfSz-aHvwS78/w640-h396/empathy%20machine.png" alt="Capture of headline: Is VR the ultimate empathy machine?" width="640" height="396" border="0" data-original-height="449" data-original-width="726" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Someone seems to think so.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Research on empathy indicates that this is an area of risk. Because of a first-person point of view in many XR experiences, learners perceive a direct impact of the experience which is meant to foster empathy. However, empathy, like presence, is nuanced. Indeed, in some empathy research, learners did not react with a positive and caring response, but instead with disgust and rejection (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://sts.stanford.edu/publications/experience-demand-what-virtual-reality-how-it-works-and-what-it-can-do" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bailenson</a>, 2018). Thus, the objective of the experience might be not only missed but soured.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Clark, when writing about accessible pedagogy in immersive learning, advised to avoid first-person depictions of marginalized groups because XR experiences cannot portray the depth and spectrum of a person‚Äôs life. ‚ÄúInstead of teaching students what it‚Äôs like to be blind, consider having them deconstruct the ways vision is assumed in how spaces are designed, as well as the ways their understandings of vision impact how they interact with others,‚Äù then ‚Äúfocus on bringing awareness to the assumptions built into the physical world around them‚Äù (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://dlfteach.pubpub.org/pub/vol2-clark-recommendations-for-accessible-pedagogy-with-immersive-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer">J. Clark</a>, 2021, Recommended Administrative Considerations section, para. 4). Therefore, <strong>XR to foster empathy should be approached with extreme caution.</strong></p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">6 Learners and Instructors Like It</h3>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This learning claim, that learners liking a learning experience will then learn more, is perhaps the most common. To the contrary, there is no research-based connection between liking an experience and learning success (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/manuscript/2016-29687-001.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hughes, Gregory, Joseph, et al</a>., 2016; <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.unlv.edu/sites/default/files/page_files/27/Engineering-MetaAnalysis-BobUttl.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uttl, White, &amp; Gonzalez</a>, 2017) . <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.worklearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Thalheimer-The-Learning-Transfer-Evaluation-Model-Report-for-LTEM-v11.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thalheimer</a> further discounted the connection between learners liking their learning and achieving their learning, when he stated that ‚Äúmeasuring interest is an inadequate way of measuring learning‚Äù (2018, p. 26). Therefore, while it is pleasant for learners to enjoy an experience, it has no firm connection to a learning outcome. Beyond the learner, education professionals should use caution when thinking that emotional motivation will work <strong>over the long term</strong>. Instructors often become enthralled with possibilities of XR and start to believe that the feeling of being there (a combination of presence, embodiment, and immersion) will make a positive difference. <strong>Research and theory are not forecasting this.</strong> However, the flame of excitement among professionals should not be extinguished. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=v1uzCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;ots=TNCJkGdMdm&amp;dq=clark%20mayer&amp;lr&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clark and Mayer</a> advocated for a <i>tempered</i> approach where the ID can keep to the best learning practices and not be distracted by the media:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">‚ÄúThe challenge in e‚Äêlearning, as in any learning program, is to build lessons in ways that are compatible with human learning processes. To be effective, instructional strategies must support these processes. That is, they must foster the psychological events necessary for learning. While the computer technology for delivery of e‚Äêlearning is upgraded regularly, <strong>the human side of the equation‚Äîthe neurological infrastructure underlying the learning process‚Äîis very old</strong> and designed for change only over evolutionary time spans. In fact, technology can easily deliver more sensory data than the human nervous system can process. <strong>To the extent that attention‚Äêgrabbing audio and visual elements in a lesson interfere with human cognition, learning will be depressed</strong>‚Äù (2016, p. 24, emphasis added).</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">7 Near Versus Far Transfer</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Claims about near transfer outcomes will be addressed just ahead [look for Whitney]. Results showing positive far transfer from XR applications, however, are elusive in a similar way to the retention results. Research shows equivalent or mixed performance to traditional media (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.bendsawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kaplan-et-al-2020-VR-AR-and-MR-as-Training-Metaanalysis.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaplan, Cruit, Endsley, et al</a>., 2021; <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcal.12375" rel="noopener noreferrer">Makransky, Borre‚ÄêGude, &amp; Mayer</a>, 2019) or worse performance (Makransky, Terkildsen, &amp; Mayer, 2019; <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/manuscript/2018-03101-001.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parong &amp; Mayer</a>, 2018). In particular, Mayer offered the Immersion Principle in 2020 which stated: ‚ÄúPeople do not necessarily learn better in 3D immersive virtual reality than with a corresponding 2D desktop presentation‚Äù (p. 357).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Intuitively, because XR can replicate real world environments where the learning <i>would be applied</i>, far transfer seems like a reachable goal. (Tlili, Huang, Shehata, et al., 2022) wrote that the technology can enhance and allow for transfer. Johnson-Glenberg noted that despite requests for more research into XR, ‚Äúresources and affordable technologies were not readily available‚Äù (2018, p. 7) for educational research and that ‚Äúlongitudinal effects of VR exposure are unknown at this point‚Äù (2018, p. 11). <strong>It is possible that not enough time has passed for the research community to measure the ‚Äòfar‚Äô in far transfer.</strong> In general, the ability to do worked practice exercises repeatedly in simulated real-world contexts suggests that XR should be <strong>at least equivalent</strong> when compared to other media for far transfer.¬†</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">8 Positives Get Published</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Research with positive results is published more often than research with negative or no results. This is not unique to metaverse applications. This is known as <strong>publication bias</strong> or the file drawer problem (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10972-016-9475-2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lederman &amp; Lederman</a>, 2016). It limits the results of a meta-analysis because if a particular form of learning is not effective, it usually is not published (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-019-00051-3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cofr√©, N√∫√±ez., Santib√°√±ez et al.</a>, 2019). Thus, <strong>the published collection showing positive results with XR dominates over the no significant difference results.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">As an added caveat, IDs should closely examine research funding <i>sources</i> and <i>sponsors.</i></p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">IDs are cautioned to examine metaverse research studies for these two major characteristics:</p>
<ol class="article-editor-content__ordered-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Novelty effect.</strong> The novelty effect is when learners are exposed to a new media and they engage in increased effort and attention. It tends to positively impact learning outcomes (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/transitions-in-student-motivation-during-a-muve-based-ecosystem-science-curriculum/230841" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metcalf, Chen, Kamarainen, et al</a>., 2019) but not always (Huang, Roscoe, Johnson‚ÄêGlenberg, et al., 2021). Further, "studies of virtual reality-based learning are based on only short-term implementations, and although they might show statistically significant learning outcomes, the novelty effect is an important caveat to the research because many of these studies do not account for the decay of outcomes over longer periods of time." (Metcalf, Chen, Kamarainen et al., 2019, p. 97)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>If a research study implements a one-time 20-minute XR intervention and claims to show learning improvement, the learners are likely experiencing the novelty effect.</strong></p>
<ol class="article-editor-content__ordered-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Non-cognitively comparable methods.</strong> Studies where the learner is not put into the same cognitive workload with two different media should be viewed with skepticism over claims of better results (Reigeluth &amp; Honebein, 2023). For example, if a study stated that learners performed better in XR than paper-and-pencil-based learning, the results should be discounted due to the varying cognitive impact that the different media had on the learner (Parong &amp; Mayer, 2021). In one example, the experimental learner group was exposed to VR training after the standard training and then scored higher than the control group (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1422600/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seymour, Gallagher, Roman, et al.</a>, 2002). The total training time increased. <i>This could have caused higher scores.</i> The two conditions, therefore, were not comparable. Furthermore, <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://doi.org/10.17226/24783" rel="noopener noreferrer">the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</a> noted that the prevalence of WEIRD populations (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) used in educational research inherently exclude diverse learner populations and this makes it difficult to draw solid conclusions for all humans in all learning situations (2018). Thus <strong>what works for one group of learners might not work, nor even be comparable, for another group.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Clark and Mayer summarized how to examine research claims for e-learning, but these questions equally apply to XR research.</p>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">‚ÄúAre the methods, content, learners, and context like yours?</p>

[Editor Heather here: How many of y'all KNOW what the phrase "statistically significant" means? I thought so. I'll write a future article on it so that you stop banging the "XR will make a significant difference in education" phrase around. I <i>hate</i> that. Be warned.]</p>

<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Does the effect size favor the experimental group at a 0.5 level or higher (2016, p. 63)?"</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Longer term and wider implementation decisions, however, should be made more systematically, by thinking and rethinking the design decisions over time. IDs rarely have control over the large financial decisions that XR development requires, so their role can be one of consultant: offering all the options and pros and cons of each to the decision makers (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://edtechbooks.org/id_highered/immersive_learning_e" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dodds</a>, 2021).

                <p id="ember1246" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This conceptual series proposes instructional design principles for the metaverse. You've arrived at Part 2 where I cover theory, application, and scope. </span></p>
<p id="ember1247" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> If you are a theory nerd like me, you'll love this part. If not, hang on to your butts.¬†</span></p>
<h2 class="ember-view"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Theory and application</span></h2>
<p id="ember1249" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Metaverse educational experiences, as replications of known reality, <i>can draw from every major learning theory already in existence</i> because metaverse experiences are often <strong>copies</strong> of the real world. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2022_404">Checa and Bustillo</a> asserted that constructivism, behaviorism, cognitivism, and connectivism can be foundations for a wide variety of XR pedagogical approaches (2023). However, the specific affordances of presence and embodiment in the metaverse indicate that existing approaches that include simulations and experiential learning are applicable (Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023; <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2018.00081/full?source=post_page---------------------------">Johnson-Glenberg, 2018</a>; <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=csqLAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=reigeluth&amp;ots=7I8aePlS1h&amp;sig=3pERHpIXV66BoY1VuGBfXT2e8d8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Reigeluth, &amp; Carr-Chellman, 2009</a>). Specifically, cognitivism and constructivism theories are often cited for the metaverse. </span></p>
<p id="ember1250" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> On the other hand, there is new research calling for more nuanced theories that reflect the social and learner-centered environments in the metaverse, e.g. connectivism or complexity theory (Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11423-021-10005-8">Schmidt &amp; Glaser, 2021</a>). Cognitivism and constructivism will be expanded upon here as they relate to research and application, beginning with cognitivism. </span></p>
<p id="ember1251" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Cognitive learning theory historically reflects the strong influence from the computer science discipline wherein XR applications are understood as input/output platforms controlled by programming. Learner experiences are transactional and computational. A learner is faced with a choice, they take that choice, and the program reacts. As such, the experiences appear to have a cause-and-effect flow with computers and learners both mediating the processing. For instructional designers specifically, a deeper understanding of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, where visuals and audio have been studied with respect to learning, is required to apply the advice within Section 4 of this series.</span></p>
<p id="ember1252" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Theories begin with a set of assumptions based on observation. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview">Mayer‚Äôs (2020</a>) cognitive theory of multimedia design has three critical assumptions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Dual channel:</strong> Humans can accept information only via sight and sound inputs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Limited capacity:</strong> Humans have neuronal limits as to how fast information can be sensed, kept in working memory, and then moved to long-term memory.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Active processing:</strong> Humans bring prior experiences to their learning and actively think about information as they are processing it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p id="ember1253" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Based on those assumptions, the cognitive theory of multimedia design focuses on the human processing system.¬†</span></p>

<p id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1256" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> There are two input channels (eyes and ears) where words and pictures enter sensory memory, then processing through working memory where sounds and images may interchange and conflict, finally moving to long term memory where information is integrated into prior knowledge. Words can be sensed by both eyes and ears. Selecting which words to focus on can cause conflict because the brain converts words to sounds inside of processing. This increases cognitive workload if an external voice is speaking while the learner‚Äôs internal voice is reading. This theory is relevant in that immersive experiences can provide words, voices, and graphics which, <i><strong>when simultaneously present</strong></i> in working memory, can increase cognitive workload, making long-term learning difficult. Because XR can provide an immersive environment of words, text, and sound surrounding learners, the risk is high that learners could be exposed to these cognitive conflicts. Section 4 will explore these pitfalls and how to avoid them. I will look briefly at constructivism next.¬†</span></p>
<p id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1257" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Constructivist learning theory postulates that learners construct their knowledge through experience; learners do not arrive as blank slates. With a wide variety of possibilities of the metaverse, IDs can think that constructivism represents a constantly growing approach to learning - learners could even create objects in 3D to construct their knowledge. However, a closer examination of this theory is required. In constructivism, new knowledge is connected to older knowledge in a way similar to the act of construction, just as boards are attached one upon another to build up a building. For IDs, constructivist theory appears both while designing step-wise learning experiences and in knowing that learners arrive in XR <i>with preconceptions from prior experiences</i> (Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023). It is in these preconceptions that learners will recognize and begin to process the experience. For example, if a learner arrives in an office building XR environment, they may begin to process the experience as work training. In this way, the learner might not need to be prompted that work behaviors are expected.¬†</span></p>
<h2 id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Givens</span></h2>
<p id="ember1259" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> It is important to note that both of these theories keep <strong>the learner,</strong> not the technology, <strong>primarily in mind</strong> when thinking of how learning will occur. Drawing from the indicated research, two further assumptions are held in this series and will be treated as givens:</span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p id="ember1254" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Learners experience the virtual as real. (<a href="https://sts.stanford.edu/publications/experience-demand-what-virtual-reality-how-it-works-and-what-it-can-do">Bailenson, 2018</a>, p. 46)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Learning outcomes are expected to be equal to other media. (Mayer, 2020, p. 357)</span></li>
</ol>
<p id="ember1260" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1261" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Understanding how theory informs daily practice and design requires some finesse as rarely does an ID wake up and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to design pure cognitivist lessons today.‚Äù </span></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<blockquote id="ember1262" class="ember-view"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Instead,<strong> theory provides the guide when the ID is facing a decision where the better path is not apparent. </strong></span></blockquote>
<p id="ember1263" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Theories offer ‚Äúguidelines on motivations, learning processes and learning outcomes for the learners‚Äù (Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023, p.5). A theory can point to methods, approaches, and strategies. Indeed, the mistake of not drawing upon a learning theory that is apparent in earlier research should not be repeated (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leonel-Morgado/publication/368434277_Educational_Practices_and_Strategies_with_Immersive_Learning_Environments_Mapping_of_Reviews_for_using_the_Metaverse/links/63ffc7680cf1030a5661703e/Educational-Practices-and-Strategies-with-Immersive-Learning-Environments-Mapping-of-Reviews-for-using-the-Metaverse.pdf">Beck, Morgado, &amp; O‚ÄôShea</a>, 2023; Checa &amp; Bustillo, 2023; <a href="https://moodle2.units.it/pluginfile.php/562229/mod_resource/content/2/Brit%20J%20Educational%20Tech%20-%202014%20-%20Fowler%20-%20Virtual%20reality%20and%20learning%20%20Where%20is%20the%20pedagogy.pdf">Fowler, 2015</a>).</span></p>

<p id="ember1264" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Overall, this series lands squarely within <a href="https://archive.org/details/pasteursquadrant00stok">Pasteur's Quadrant</a>, contributing to both fundamental and practical applications (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36741-4.pdf">Shi &amp; Evans, 2023</a>).¬†</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Pasteur's Quadrant: The type of research that quests for fundamental understanding AND can be used every day, like pasteurization. This article series lands in that sweet spot.</span></p>
<p id="ember1267" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This series is fundamental because it draws primarily from the cognitive theory of multimedia design and it examines research designs and results. It is practical in that it provides many examples based on the author‚Äôs XR design experiences. (You'll see, it's coming in a future Part.) As Mayer suggested, this type of approach is ‚Äúbasic research in applied situations‚Äù (2020, p. 22). Pasteur‚Äôs Quadrant lends light on exploratory topics. In this case, I have some basic theory from 2D learning, but there is much more 3D nuance unknown. Progress in this field will require that theory and applied research move forward hand in hand. </span></p>
<p id="ember1264" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"></p>
<p id="ember1268" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> Fortunately, being in Pasteur‚Äôs quadrant provides hints at further unanswered puzzles beyond this series. For example, what is the connection between the popular XR game emotional coinage of fear and successful XR applications for the training of the emergency services: fire, police, military, and medical personnel? The answer to that quest will wait for another day. Before I begin an examination of research myths (upcoming Part 3), I need to explain what can and cannot be covered in a series of this breadth.</span></p>
<h2 class="ember-view"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Scope</span></h2>
<p id="ember1270" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> This series leaves many topics by the wayside: defining the metaverse in education, qualifying and categorizing experiences, affordances and constraints, and accessibility options. Doubtless, each of those topics deserves a series of its own [note to self] but there is no space to address them here. This series does provide insight into four areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">interpreting research to rout out myths</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">looking for the characteristics of success in XR educational designs</span></li>

<p id="ember1272" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> The specific research gap that this series addresses is the missing connection between known design principles and practical applications of ID in the metaverse. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370221242_The_Immersion_Principle_in_Multimedia_Learning">Makransky</a> commented on the lack of connection between the cognitive theory of multimedia design and instructional design in virtual reality,¬† stating that ‚Äúresearch that has investigated instructional design implications in immersive learning environments is severely limited‚Äù (2023, p. 5). Beck, Morgado, and O‚ÄôShea surveyed that ‚Äúmostly papers discuss opportunities and challenges or compare outcomes, rather than expose details on educational practices or strategies‚Äù (2023, p. 2).¬† Reigeluth and Honebein suggested that research-to-prove should be replaced with research-to-improve when a technology is in its early developmental stage (2023). Such research should limit itself to suggesting ‚Äúpossible ideas for actions and improvement‚Äù (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles-Reigeluth/publication/371304955_How_Do_We_Solve_a_Problem_Like_Media_and_Methods_207/links/647e04b6b3dfd73b7767f1d2/How-Do-We-Solve-a-Problem-Like-Media-and-Methods-207.pdf">Reigeluth &amp; Honebein, 2023</a>, p. 2). Finally, the emergent use of XR technology has precipitated haphazard designs lacking guidance:</span></p>
<p id="ember1273" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> "In these early days, trial and error plays an outsized role in design. Education researchers borrow heavily from the entertainment designers, who focus on engagement, and not necessarily on retention of content. The dearth of studies highlights the urgency for a set of guidelines for designing content that allows users to make appropriate choices in a spherical space." (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018, p. 7).</span></p>
<p id="ember1274" class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"> It is hoped that this series lends to two facets of instructional design. First, the <strong>thinking</strong> side of design, when a designer must choose one approach or another. This series strives to give the best advice. Second, the <strong>implementing</strong> side of design where designers arrive directly into the metaverse to see what their learners will experience. This series, then, points the way.¬†</span></p>
