                <p><span style="font-family: arial;">The next myth is that learning in immersive experiences is active, kinesthetic, or like an internship, which is ‚Äúthe way most people learn best‚Äù (D‚ÄôAgostino, 2022, para 17.) Spoiler: no it is not.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Active learning was first associated with immersive experiences because learners could observe or engage with or, more properly described, engage within simulations (Dede, 2009). The term active simply meant that the learner was present at a simulated place and time; the original use of the active learning phrase with reference to immersive experiences did not imply that a learner could do anything other than observe. The emphasis was much more on the time and space travel afforded by XR.<br><br>This claim has been controversial (Khorasani et al., 2023), in part because of the differing degrees of activity that a learner can have - ranging from simply being inside an immersive environment and observing (e.g. historical re-enactment simulations) to taking actions that have non-trivial consequences (e.g. practicing a surgical technique).<br><br></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Active learning is a phrase on the move</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Dede (2009) referred to <strong>actional immersion</strong> as situations where learner actions have ‚Äúnovel, intriguing consequences‚Äù that are ‚Äúhighly motivating and sharply focus attention.‚Äù (p. 66). The active learning claim moved from a focus on the <strong><i>learner‚Äôs actions</i></strong> and instead focused on the <strong><i>learner‚Äôs body ownership</i></strong> illusion. Further, the relationship between user bodies and virtual depictions (avatars) was reformulated and later called <strong>implicit learning</strong> (Slater, 2017, p. 29). <br><br>I want to pause here and really dissect the difference because in this area, there has definitely been vocabulary "drift".¬† Learner's actions focus on what the learner causes to happen.¬† Learner's body ownership focuses on parts of the body that the learner uses to cause actions.<br><br>For example, picture a chemistry lab simulation. </span></p>

They are using a mouse and moving their hand generally right to left.¬† No hand needs to be visible to do these actions. Activities could be "ghost like" in that they could be caused by no visual physical object whatsoever.¬† In reality, the computer mouse is doing the most physical 'work'.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Focusing on the <strong>learner's body ownership</strong> however, would have the learner reaching out (they need to be able to reach) to the pipette, to grab it (they need to be able to firmly grasp), to possible depress the button on the top to create the needed suction, to move the pipette, see the liquid and subsequent vial, and depress the button to dispense the liquid. The movements could be all right to left. Key in this visual depiction, however, is A HAND with workable fingers that is somehow connection via experience to a learner's IRL hand.<br><br><br>In the former example, the learner causes the actions to occur but we are not focused on their body parts doing the action. In the latter example, we are very interested in the body parts doing work that is replicate (in this case) to the real world work of operating a pipette. In the former, we could have confidence that a learner is exposed to the cause and effect of pipette work; it sucks up a reliable amount of liquid and can squirt it back out. In the latter, we could have confidence that a learner is exposed to how pipettes physically work (button press down equal prime for suck, release equals suck, button press down again equals squirt).¬† <br><br>See that the focus is different?<br><br>My point is that the FOCUS of what was coming to be called <strong><i>active learning</i></strong> with reference to XR was changing already between 2009 and 2017.</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Drawing from the educational history of the Montessori method and considering the interfaces available within immersive experiences, implicit bodily learning (from 2017) transformed to <strong>embodied learning</strong> (by 2018). Indeed, Johnson-Glenberg initially postulated that ‚Äúdoing actual physical gestures in a virtual environment should have positive, and lasting, effects on learning in the real world‚Äù (2018, p. 1). <i>Movement became synonymous with active learning</i>. ‚ÄúActive, motor-driven concepts may stimulate distributed semantic networks (meaning), as well as the associated motor cortices which would have been used to learn long ago, in childhood‚Äù (Johson Glenberg, 2018 p. 3). [Hat tip, by the way to all research into the mind-body connection within learning. This post throws no shade on the phenomena.] With specific, other than meaningful, actions now excluded, some researchers appeared to support the claim that all movement somehow begets learning. (That sentence is confusing, I wrote it and even I'm wondering what I meant. It's this: Inside a XR-for-learning experience, a learner might be instructed to do something. Pick this up, move it there.¬† Because that learning is specific to the learning event, I'm setting it aside. It's not part of this argument.¬† What I am referring to are the learner-instigated but non-instructed movements. Let's say, a learner joins XR and wanders to the left for 2 minutes before a lesson begins. Or let's say instead of looking to the "front" at the end of the experience, the learner is looking to the "back". These random but learner-instigated actions are...wait for it...somehow the secret sauce of learning in XR.¬† I kid you not. I really try to pin down the meaning from educators that belief this myth and THIS is what they come up with; because you can move in XR, you are learning (more) in XR.<br></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Did you catch that? Aren't the emperor's new clothes splendid?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">By incorporating the word ‚Äúactive‚Äù educators are reminded of the belief that active learning is better than passive learning (Slater, 2017). Ooo! Shade thrown there, for sure, because no teacher wants to be accused of being a passive educator.<br><br></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[BTW, there is reams of garbage research out there for anyone looking for a topic. Go ahead and dig into active versus passive in educational psychology papers. It's almost as big of a research garbage dump as XR; teachers radically redefine and appeal to this topic. My point is that the appeal to "active learning" when coupled with XR provides scant evidence of such. To this day, I RARELY see active learning in XR.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Let's bear down now. To be specific, the 'active learning' coupling with 'XR' claim is not about being fidgety, randomly moving about, or purely reacting as a user would in a game. It is movement, usually performed by the learner via an avatar or minimally via hand controllers where the learner is autonomously and purposely manipulating content.¬† This is known as embodiment or embodied learning (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018; Markowitz et al., 2018) although definitions of embodiment vary. The definitions vary including how much a learner is embodied. It should also be noted that the term<i> embodiment</i> is often used interchangeably with ‚Äòembodied learning‚Äô, which is a theory that the meaningful gestures in and with the environment aid a learner‚Äôs cognitive processes (that's the no shade thing I referred to earlier). But even 'embodiment' and 'embodied learning' are slightly different things. Whew! Keeping up?<br></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Emperor's clothes <em>should be</em> splendid </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>In 2018, Johnson-Glenberg claimed that presence and embodiment were ‚Äúprofound affordances‚Äù of immersive environments and this embodiment affordance should facilitate learner control, also known as agency (p. 1). One further hat tip to Mina: she did actually use a somewhat scientific body action in her research --I believe it was catching butterflies with a butterfly net-- something that biologists WOULD do with their bodies. So it's a real world action.¬† I point this out because some XR actions are nonsensical. I'm looking at you people who change vocabulary words to bouncing balls or something.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But aren't</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>A follow-up paper by Mina, however, found that while embodiment does have a connection to learning, it does not exclusively cause learning, or perhaps better said,<strong> it doesn't interact with learning</strong>. Referring to high or low embodied VR and the connection to learning, ‚Äúplatform is not destiny‚Äù (Johnson‚ÄêGlenberg et al., 2021, p. 20). So in lay talk that means it had no effect.</span></p>

Because active learning is considered better than passive learning, claims are made that immersive experiences must cause more learning due to the body-movement connection. The research, however, does not support that claim.<br><br>The active learning myth appears to be referred to more often in academic literature than evidence to the contrary. It is true that immersive experiences can allow for more movement-based learning experiences than other forms of media, but it is not definitive that immersive experiences cause learning simply because they can contain learner movement or agency.</span></p>

<h1>Myth: Learners learn more in immersive experiences</h1>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>This¬†<span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">myth shrouds itself within a cloak of research. Citations will state that learning in immersive experiences is somehow greater when pitted against an <i>implied</i> traditional learning approach. The claim could appear as retention, but it is related to how well the learning was accomplished when measured up against learning objectives or a final goal.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">When referring to the PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC) report results mentioned earlier in this article series, Scott Likens claimed, ‚ÄúWe found the realism and performance feedback in virtual reality simulations helped people learn faster and retain more information around soft skills,‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 9). He claimed they <strong>retained more information</strong>. This specific claim has been <i>repeated</i> in academic literature, which stated, ‚ÄúStudies have found that students who use XR training are more engaged with the content, display more confidence with the material, and retain more information than students who use traditional training methods.‚Äù (Rode, 2024, para 2.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">A close examination of the PwC report, however, reveals that the claim was unsupported within the report‚Äôs own data. When comparing information retention in VR versus an e-learning course, the authors ‚Äúquickly discovered retention scores were inconclusive, as the delta between pre-and post-assessments in each modality was not significant‚Äù (Eckert &amp; Mower, 2020, p. 44). Thus, there was no statistical difference between VR-based, e-learning, and traditional classroom learning.</span></p>

<p>The r<span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">eport therefore does not provide statistical evidence of more or greater learning within VR, yet it has been cited in academic publications (O'Dwyer, 2021, Etienne et al., 2022,¬† Jelki et al., 2022; B√§ckelin, 2023; Etienne et al., 2023; L√∏nne et al,. 2023) and touted in media outlets (Murad, 2023; Schwantes, 2020). For the dubious claims, the report has been debunked as untrustworthy (Neelen &amp; Kirschner, 2020).¬†</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">There are similar claims about greater learning retained from immersive experiences. Advocates for digital twin campus environments claimed that they ‚Äúcreate greater retention of the information that is learned‚Äù (D‚ÄôAgustino, 2022, para. 5) and ‚Äústudents' grades go up‚Äù (Victory XR, 2024, Who We Are).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">In another example, the CEO of the Miami Children‚Äôs Health System touted that learners had 80% retention after one year after using VR, but traditional learners had 20% retention. A close look at the supporting documentation shows that the CEO actually said that the difference between VR learners and traditional learners can be the 80% to 20% difference.¬†</span></p>

The CEO explained their claim by saying that, ‚ÄúThe level of understanding through VR is great because humans are primarily visual, and VR is a visual format‚Äù (Gaudiosi, 2021, para. 4).

Some claims are extreme. One keynote speaker, Alvin Graylin, speaking as a leader at HTC (a VR headset maker) declared that as a result of VR use in the classroom, ‚ÄúEvery single child has the potential to be a genius‚Äù (Educators in VR, 2020, 23:33).</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Justification for the greater learning or retention claims seems to be conjecture. Claims refer to how real an immersive experience feels to a learner. Returning to the PwC report, Likens credited ‚Äúthe realism and performance feedback‚Ä¶helped people..retain more information.‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 9). But <strong>long term studies measuring retention are hard to find</strong> within the body of academic literature. Some studies measure retention three weeks after the immersive experiences. Given that many of the examples of immersive experiences relate to hands-on disciplines like nursing or construction, things learned in immersive experiences would be needed on the job more than three weeks after the training.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Hamilton et al. (2020) stated that finding ‚Äúlearning outcomes, intervention characteristics, and assessment measures associated with immersive virtual reality has been sparse‚Äù (p. 1). Beck, Morgado, and O‚ÄôShea (2023) pointed out that details of methods are missing so that outcomes become questionable, ‚ÄúVery few literature reviews focus on the educational practices and strategies used in immersive learning environments. Thus, the problem is that we are evaluating outcomes without a comparable way to describe the educational approaches that led to those outcomes‚Äù (p. 2). Lawson et al. (2024) completed a systematic review of immersive experiences and found that research studies rarely isolate instructional methods and conditions when describing research studies and thus impact real world classroom decisions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Meta analyses are starting to illuminate this area. Akg√ºn and Atƒ±cƒ± (2022) observed that there was only a moderate effect on learner achievement after surveying 31 studies. Kaplan, Cruit, Endsley, Beers, Sawyer and Hancock found that ‚ÄúXR does not express a different outcome than training in a non-simulated, control environment. It is equally effective at enhancing performance‚Äù (2020, p. 1) Some researchers are starting to incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence into this challenge in order to determine what the published records states about immersive experiences. Markowitz et al. (2024) recently surveyed 196,734 paper abstracts with this method.</span></p>

<p data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">I find this myth is misleading.

                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Dispelling Myths</h1>
<p>With some background established on boom and bust cycles in the hype for immersive experiences (Parts <a href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/10/from-myths-to-principles-navigating.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>, <a href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-immersive-environment-delusion-part.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a>, and <a href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/11/part-3-case-against-virtual-campuses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3</a>), we need to dismiss the rather rampant myths about learning within immersive experiences. In the hype, learning advantages have been overstated and over simplified. Web pages post outrageous claims (and I‚Äôll show you!). Keynote presentations banty incredible promises (yup, it was recorded). This series addresses the four primary myths about learning within immersive experiences: that is, that it is faster, greater, active, and induces empathy. <br><br>In this Part 4, I‚Äôll address the ‚Äúlearners learn faster in immersive experiences‚Äù myth. For those of you that follow my writing, you‚Äôll know that this is Round 3 of me taking on this myth. My argument has not changed; remember this article series is an update, but not every point needs updating. However, I continue to communicate about this because the ‚ÄúVR learning is faster‚Äù myth continues to circulate‚Äì mostly in the reference to ‚Äú4 times faster‚Äù and the PwC report. So, TLDR, the VR experience was designed to be 29 minutes long. That‚Äôs it. No longer. The classroom equivalent in content experience was designed to be 2 hours long. That‚Äôs it. 29 minutes is ¬º of 120 minutes. Someone inverted ¬º to 4x (which is factually true) and PwC who appears to have had a cozy contract with Oculus/Meta at the time, went out to trumpet the ‚Äòfour times‚Äô from the rooftops. But students do NOT learn faster. They experienced a learning event that was designed to be faster. Had the learners spent 120 minutes in the headset, someone would have probably greedily snatched the headset off their heads and told them that they overstayed their welcome (and wondered what they were doing for the extra 91 minutes).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Myth: Learners learn faster in immersive experiences</h2>
<p>The first myth asserts that learners learn faster with immersive experiences. Particularly, the phrase ‚Äúfour times faster‚Äù has taken root in the publications and in public discourse. A google search on the phrase ‚ÄúVR is 4 times faster‚Äù returns a plethora of results repeating the myth.</p>

And it's not hard to catch, yo.</figcaption></figure>
<p><br>The source of this phrase is suggested to be one non-peer reviewed industry report by PricewaterhouseCooper. Within the report, VR-based learning was ‚Äú4x faster than classroom training on average‚Äù (Eckert &amp; Mower, 2020, p. 8). The results of this report were then repeated in academic literature.</p>

<p>Referring to the same report, D. Clark (an educational researcher not known for getting data wrong, but he did) wrote enthusiastically that ‚ÄúVR was x4 faster than classroom and x1.5 faster than e-learning‚Äù (2021, p. 190). Claims that learning is completed faster attempt to represent immersive experiences as a more efficient learning method, i.e., less time to learn equals learning faster.</p>
<p><br>Tracking down how many academic papers have cited the PwC report is difficult. I've seen numbers as little as 4 citations and much higher numbers if I start flexing my search. Part of the problem is that folks have not cited the report (even though it calls itself a study) correctly. Some credit PwC, a few find the Eckert and Mower authors, but in general the hand wave approach to referring to the 4x data is very prevalent.</p>
<p><br><br>The cause of this supposed faster learning was attributed to how a VR headset isolates the learner‚Äôs perception, so that the learner is focused on the learning task at hand. In other words, less distraction equals more focus. In the PricewaterhouseCooper report, Likens seemed to hypothesize that, ‚ÄúA lot of courses that normally take an hour could be completed in 20 minutes through VR because people are so immersed in scenarios, there are fewer distractions and the learning is very concentrated‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 10). <br><br>To be clear, in the PwC case, classroom learning which covered the same content was designed to take two hours to complete. The immersive experience was designed to take 29 minutes. Given that 29 minutes is approximately one-quarter of two hours, PwC inverted the time ratio and touted the line that the immersive learning was four times faster. The problem is that it is not true that learning in the immersive experience was faster. The VR-based learning took less time because it was designed to be a 29-minute one-on-one learning experience designed for a shorter total time duration. When compared to classroom learning, it is already known that one-on-one personalized learning is generally faster; it moves at the speed of the learner, not at the speed of the class. Perhaps, this is how myths begin. A kernel of truth gets extended to something with no context. Lack of context is a noted and rising problem in educational research (Williamson, 2024).<br><br>Learning faster can be confused with greater efficiency. Efficiency could have a wide range of meanings beyond just taking less time. It could also mean wiser use of resources or less teaching burden on the instructor. Another example of the loose wordplay is on an industry webpage that displayed that VR training was 50% faster than a traditional in-person medical simulation. Not stated in the distilled summary of that study is that <em>learners scored worse in the VR training than the traditional</em> in-person medical simulation (Katz et al., 2020).</p>

<p><br><br>The myth that learning happens faster continues when educators fail to acknowledge that a different instructional method was being used. When supporting using virtual reality for chemistry studies, Muhsinah Morris, a chemistry professor and metaverse program director at Morehouse said ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt see molecules, but in my virtual reality classroom where I taught advanced inorganic chemistry, you can. You can actually build three-dimensional representations of molecules ‚Ä¶ The learning tends to happen faster. They go on to the real situation faster.‚Äù (D‚ÄôAgostino, 2022, para. 5).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Side point: Learning Chemistry in Three Dimensions</h2>
<p>Since this is my publishing space, I am going to spend some time on Mushinah Morris‚Äô instructional and learning point here. Again, I was involved in the online teaching of chemistry for 14 years and my research speciality was science in VR, so I‚Äôve got thoughts. If you would like to see her talk on video on this, she‚Äôs in <a href="https://youtu.be/F3bQ4Aw3Vis?si=JuJ4QvIQS9X5USCJ&amp;t=70" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this VictoryXR video</a>.<br><br>She is correct that molecules cannot currently be seen in everyday life. It makes chemistry, as a field, a more abstract or conceptual field (along with physics) when compared to the ‚Äúyou can see it before you‚Äù fields of biology or earth science. Teaching that something unseen exists and engages in reactions has always been the uphill battle of chemistry teachers. So she‚Äôs describing an accurate problem. <br><br>There is a tiny fly in the ointment, however, in that not many students at the college level fall into a chemistry course completely unfamiliar with chemistry at all. So learners in college chemistry probably were exposed to atoms in some other prior learning experience, be it high school, a museum, or a summer-camp like situation. So do her students need to learn atoms from the very beginning? I somewhat doubt that.¬†</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">HCHE Advanced Inorganic Chemistry</h3>
<p>To massively further complicate her argument, she names and shows her chemistry course ‚ÄúAdvanced Inorganic Chemistry‚Äù. That‚Äôs HCHE 421 at Morehouse University, which in 2021 had a prerequisite: <br><br>HCHE 322 Elementary Physical Chemistry,</p>
<p>which itself has 3 prerequisites: <br><br>CHE 321/321L, Elementary Physical Chemistry and Lab (which has 4 prereqs: CHE 232, PHY 154, and MTH 161 and 162)<br><br>PHY 253 Electricity &amp; Magnetism, which has 2 prerequisites: PHY 154 (C or better) and MTH 162<br><br>MTH 271 Introduction to Linear Algebra, which has 1 prerequisite: MTH 161 <br><br>You see where I‚Äôm going here.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs highly doubtful that students arriving in an advanced chemistry class after what is <i>years at college</i>, whose content focus is actually math (that‚Äôs what inorganic focuses on) and not spatial abilities (which arguably organic chemistry DOES focus on) have a substantial problem with visualizing atoms and molecules to the point where it is disturbing their learning performance. And therefore VR could make a difference. No. Not buying it.¬†</p>

<p><br>Nonetheless, I‚Äôve known very smart people have trouble visualizing atoms. So it IS remotely possible and let‚Äôs pretend she is articulating only the beginning of the trouble of understanding for a lay crowd‚Ä¶not the only problem. Said another way, she's speaking about VR's affordances overall, maybe not specifically for her students in her aforementioned class. For example, some chemical reactions are easy to understand (like cooking) and some are difficult to understand (like how hair coloring works or cell electrical potentials).<br><br>It is interesting that she said ‚ÄúThe learning tends to happen faster.‚Äù It‚Äôs a couched statement, for sure, with the word ‚Äútends‚Äù. In science that cannot be pinned down. So she gave herself an out. But what was she describing? At this point, we have to think about the instruction of chemistry.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">How To Show Atoms and Molecules</h3>
<p>Within the history of chemistry itself is the continuing saga of how will atoms be depicted? As in, how do you draw them? How are they really? And how does a teacher relay that ‚Äòrealness‚Äô to the learners‚Äì and why?¬†</p>
<p>So we‚Äôve had our:</p>
<p>Atoms are indivisible tiny units, folks. <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Chemistry_for_Changing_Times_(Hill_and_McCreary)/02%3A_Atoms/2.01%3A_Atoms_-_Ideas_from_the_Ancient_Greeks">Thank you to the Greeks</a>! There are no pictures from that time.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve had Bohr‚Äôs heliocentric-like model folks wherein the atom looks like a solar system or set of concentric rings. To be fair, the heliocentric model really does help explain things like electron energy levels.</p>
<p>¬†</p>

<p><br>We‚Äôve had our Thomson plum pudding folks‚Äì which never translated from its culture. Which is probably a shame. I like plums.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVgn22KNTjuudLWm0L9MzuJ2O26K_9SY8GYDN4PSoeIUlztvF0e8jD3sUXDpcvqYQuJpel4RGOULljzOIaJUBE28xAdP37IVYbppmCrOC5ZmHL8xw7y9-dVRnZRHnos049QjKMsUOxHuSe8Rr1opzXbOJyq4mwbY7eFrLOoROqUAvX3GZt66KMrIU5mz4/w320-h117/plum%20pudding%20model.png" border="0" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Thompson's plum pudding atomic model.</figcaption></figure>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>We‚Äôve had our ‚Äòcloud model‚Äô folks - which are like the postmodern philosophers of chemistry. Truth for me, truth for you, we all get a truth. Which isn‚Äôt <em>actually</em> true. But they told us that electrons cannot be pinned down and measured, they could be anywhere at any time but when we set about measuring them, that‚Äôs when they run away from us. Yes, I‚Äôm nodding to Heisenberg here. And wave/particle theory.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibpJhvPiUq6dUB_5YtuQDvewBFwmWmaatUZaeCm_LDXSJ_9RcU3HZQ_19lsf70Yt8fO3wV00L0I7h7qcjsLcv3OGEp3WBeZBiUBDa-Pgyq7QVJZ3ccIS_czFNctafILtLeceAvTO2smQ3tsxJoMJAO8EaXdjiHR3s7Lq6ITOXF3eRsw02pa0lMiyV6Boo/w320-h133/Screenshot%202024-11-11%20095220.png" alt="Cloud model of what an atom looks like." width="320" height="133" border="0" data-original-height="285" data-original-width="685" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Cloud model of what an atom looks like.</figcaption></figure>
<p>After the heliocentric model, however, depictions of atoms needed to be displayed as three-dimensional, not just as two-dimensional on flat paper. By far, I‚Äôve only selected some of the atomic model theories here. If you want to know more, study chemistry! It‚Äôs not hard.<br><br>But, now, going against Mushinah Morris‚Äô arguments now, educators HAVE been working on that educational problem for years (with success, mind you).</p>
<p>First of all, delightful molecular (and atom) kits exist with physical manipulatives. Yeah, they look like tinker toys.¬† I love them. They are good for at least 30 minutes of instruction, maybe more. They are usually plastic (boo, although there is nothing stopping them from being made of wood) and the kits would have to be purchased, stored, and de-germed from time to time. So they have their minor downsides.</p>
<p>Second of all, 2D screens can show 3D objects‚Ä¶that‚Äôs entirely possible.</p>
<p>Third, programming VR to follow mathematical principles ‚Äì like, voila, chemistry DOES!-- is actually not that hard. The first uses of VR in education that I know of were in the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù---that is mathematical sciences, physics and chemistry. Let‚Äôs face it. A computer understands 9.8 meters per second per second MUCH easier than a person does. (&lt;- that‚Äôs one gravitational force).<br><br><br>And get this, purchasing a simulation to teach atoms is so drop-dead cheap that it‚Äôs actually <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">free </a>by now. I have recommended those simulations for courses before and seen learning scores do quite well, thank you.¬†</p>

<p><br>I seriously bet that if I had been able to place that counter proposal before her administrators, I‚Äôd win the budget proposal. Ha! Bonus points that I could prove that my students would score equal to her VR students on the final exam.<br><br>So in all, did she make a good point here? I‚Äôd say no but that‚Äôs because I recognize the instructional problem and I realize that the problem can be solved in a much cheaper and equally as efficient way. Also, she showed no data that ‚Äúthe learners learned faster‚Äù.<br><br>Side point to the side point: Mushinah Morris on YouTube is highly associated with VictoryXR, the vendor that she is using when referring to her VR-for-education accomplishments. Close association with XR vendors makes for suspicious conclusions. I'm not picking on Mushinah Morris unfairly. She's gone on the record multiple times for her claims. I could easily pick (and will in the future) other education influencers that are selling the VR-for-education snake oil.<br><br>Back to my article<br><br><br>Further, there is at least one study (so far!) that refutes this focusing-causes-faster-learning claim. Makransky, Terkildsen, et al. (2019) found that immersive metaverse environments could be sensory overload for learners and therefore decrease the learner‚Äôs focus. On the whole, claims for increased speed can often be attributed to more efficient instructional methods. Immersive experiences can allow for the utilization of comparatively faster instructional methods.<br><br>The author finds this myth, that immersive experiences cause learners to learn faster, false.¬†</p>

                <p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">I write this title with a tinge of irony. I‚Äôve owned virtual campuses. I‚Äôve worked on virtual campuses. If asked to work on a virtual campus again, I‚Äôd likely say yes.¬† So what‚Äôs my beef with virtual campuses? </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">I feel that a sober-eyed look at virtual campuses* is necessary.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Following the philosophy of ‚Äúthose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it‚Äù (Santayana), here is Part 3 of my series: From Myths to Principles; Navigating Instructional Design in Immersive Environments.</span></p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The rise and fall of the metaversity</span></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">In <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-immersive-environment-delusion-part.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 2</a> of this series,I examined two examples from the history of immersive learning. First, I showed the parallels when companies like Meta and Linden Lab dominate a single platform for immersive learning designs. The lesson is that what is allowed one day can quickly become disallowed the next day. Second, I pointed out the inappropriate boasting and poor course design used in the ‚Äúfirst course in virtual reality‚Äù by Stanford University. In these recent cases (Meta and Stanford University) there was a remarkable lack of awareness of the history of immersive learning. Said another way, mistakes of the past were repeated.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">In another example of history repeating itself, ten colleges and universities adopted digital twin campuses in June 2022 using the ENGAGE platform with monetary support and donated VR headsets from Meta (Koenig, 2022). These metaversity locations recreated (or <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://sway.cloud.microsoft/RyZEZBkthFHDhku7?ref=Link" rel="noopener noreferrer">created</a>!) campus buildings to allow learners to gather on the virtual campus.¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eight years prior, Second Life (SL) campus buildings were ‚Äúdesigned to mimic real-world architectural equivalents‚Äù but had become ‚Äúabandoned ghost towns‚Äù (Wecker, 2014).¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">The early Second Life virtual campus creations were often the result of student projects. Confusingly, the professors who designed and assigned these projects touted the work of creating faithful campus recreations as <i>creative</i> and thus, at the highest level of Bloom‚Äôs cognitive learning objectives. I‚Äôm inserting a heavy eye roll here because that‚Äôs really stretching the justification of working in virtual reality to an extreme point.¬† Plus, I have to point out: what does next year‚Äôs class build if this year‚Äôs class made the campus?¬† My point is that simply building campus buildings (so that you can have a virtual campus!) is a project idea that runs out of steam. Things got really interesting right after the SL virtual campuses were launched.¬† Everyone involved noticed that the spaces were not being utilized.¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">¬†</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Students were asked why they weren't visiting the virtual campus.¬† </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">The answer was simple.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">No one was there. </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">You see, you could have the most amazing design with all of the bells and whistles (really!), but if people were not there, then people found that there was no compelling reason to return. Admissions folks had no compelling reason to be in the virtual admissions building, same for financial aid teams. Even library teams today in virtual reality struggle to staff spaces with the same spread as IRL (in real life) libraries.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">During a recent tour of the University of Maryland Global Campus metaversity campus, the audio connection failed. The host did not offer any tech support. The experience showcased empty buildings during what was a busy time of the academic semester. To be fair, I understand the implications of FERPA which might have predicted that students were in classroom spaces separate from public spaces. However, it is logical that on any campus, students could still be found¬† in public space buildings like the networking lounge. These accurate campus recreations rarely spur more than a passing interest to learners.¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph is-empty" aria-label="Write here. You can also include @mentions."><span style="font-family: arial;">¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">The ten colleges and universities in this project are now facing the end of the project and the initial funding is ending. Steven Van Hook commented that, ‚ÄúAdministrators may speak of their twin campuses in glittering terms on the record ‚Äìthen off the record talk about their regrets and what else they could have bought for the hundreds of thousands of dollars‚Äù (VWBPE, 2024). According to Temple University‚Äôs Kathy Hirsh Pasek, ‚ÄúA year ago, a lot of companies were going full steam ahead. Today‚Äôs that‚Äôs not true; they‚Äôve rerouted a lot of their funds for AI and Twitter alternatives‚Äù (Coffey, 2023, para. 37) Institutions made the decision to adopt immersive experiences but do not appear to know how to make wise decisions when generous funding stops and societal attention moves on.</span></p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The key problems</span></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, throughout these first three parts of this series, there are several challenges apparent. Instructional designers and administrators must wade through the myriad of claims derived from dubious research studies. It feels like chicanery to figure out which statements about immersive experiences for learning are authentic and do point the way to future positive outcomes and which statements are in doubt. The first issue is with interpreting research wisely. Every research study has inherent flaws; no one study can definitively provide answers to all of education‚Äôs questions. This situation is made worse when the research is translated into social media and seems to tout incredible claims (Lanier et al., 2019).</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, the conundrum has been illuminated. The myths that appear to come from a research basis must be dispelled. Next, the very basis of the published research record is at risk of bias and problems. This series will inform on what characteristics to look for in published research.¬† Finally, if one were to step around the research interpretation problems, what is the system for building and using immersive experiences for its best advantage? This series will attempt to answer these questions. This series then forms the navigator role for instructional designers and administrators figuring out how to chart a route to a successful implementation. </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__heading"><span style="font-family: arial;">Post Script</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">*virtual campuses </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">I‚Äôm using the term virtual campuses to specifically refer to real world recreations of campus spaces like quads and lecture halls. I am not referring to simulations (for example in science courses) or spaces specifically designed for social use (for example, dance halls). </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Virtual campuses were designed as early as 1999 as text-based educational MUVEs (multi user virtual environments). This example classroom shows ‚Äúthe room‚Äôs description, list of contents, who¬† is in the room, the exits, and links to applications‚Äù (Maher, et al., 1999).</span></p>

<div id="docs-internal-guid-195a7ea9-7fff-f06d-26c5-8b3e4fa397e0" style="line-height: 1.56; margin-bottom: 2pt; margin-top: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The history of educational technology is a rhyme that repeats. Initial pitches have created optimism that the next big thing in technology will revolutionize education. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/07/the-computer-delusion/376899/">Oppenheimer</a> (1997) in a really well written article illustrated part of the history of educational technology by citing four examples:</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Edison‚Äôs 1922 prediction that the motion picture will revolutionize education.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Levenson‚Äôs claim that radios will become common in every classroom.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Skinner asserted that learners with teaching machines could learn twice as much.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Clinton campaigned that computers are a bridge to the twenty-first century. (para. 1)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The motion picture, the radio receiver, programmed instruction, and computers in the classroom have all failed to significantly impact learner performance. The past 102 years have not been kind to hyped educational technology predictions.</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: left;">I can hear you through the nether. <br>There are some saying "But the metaverse is different!" <br>Sit down. üëàüò†<br>I'll deal with you soon enough.</div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>Cuban (1986) further suggested that this educational technology adoption cycle follows a predictable pattern. First, the earliest research will be produced by the technology producers themselves. Second, problems arise with adoption. Learner performance does not improve over the long term. The final stage in the cycle is blame-finding with reasons ranging from not enough money, educator resistance, and educational systems resistant to change. The methods and reasoning for incorporating the technology are rarely addressed in the historical or market record. The reader of this series might recognize these statements already being made about immersive experiences. As such, hype cycles for immersive experiences are already underway.<br>¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This last point deserves emphasis. Here are the steps again:</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>1. Tech producers make the first "research".<br>2. Tech adopted, but learner performance does not improve long term.<br>3. Blame-finding ensues.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>I wanted to emphasize these points because they are going to appear in the research record that I will present. </span></div>
<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-195a7ea9-7fff-f06d-26c5-8b3e4fa397e0" style="line-height: 1.56; margin-bottom: 2pt; margin-top: 12pt; text-align: left;"></h1>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Immersive experiences have already weathered several boom and bust cycles. One cycle began between 2003 and 2009. The desktop-based virtual reality program called Second Life, created by Linden Lab, attracted over 100 universities (Brown &amp; Sugar, 2009) and thousands of dollars of investment (Wecker, 2014).<br><br>In a sudden decision, Linden Lab eliminated its 50% discount for educational institutions (Harrison, 2010). What resulted was an educator exodus and fracture in the faith of immersive experiences for education. When referring to the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/woodbury-u-banned-from-second-life-again">shutdown of Woodbury University‚Äôs virtual campus</a> for breach of conduct, Jordan Bellino, a senior learner at the institution, described the hazard when one major company dominates use:<br><br>The incident suggests the dangers of online meeting spaces‚Äô being run by companies, which get to decide who participates and who doesn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúIt took years and thousands of dollars to make that virtual campus happen,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand it all vanished in a matter of an hour because Linden Lab pushed a button.‚Äù (Young, 2010, para. 12)<br><br>Major technology companies can single-handedly dictate use of immersive environments. This would be a valuable lesson lost before the next boom cycle began in 2018.</span></p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>After the launch of the consumer-oriented Quest headsets and the mandate for remote learning due to the COVID pandemic in 2020, interest in immersive environments surged. In June of 2021, Stanford opened their Virtual People course to 263 learners (Bailenson, 2021).¬†</span></div>

</a></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">¬†</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The course was touted to be the first class in the world to be held inside of virtual reality (Hadhazy, 2021) which seemed to cast aside the nearly two-decade deep body of research on courses held as immersive experiences. The prestige of the course was further hyped when one of the course professors boasted:</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">I can now stand up in front of all my students and there's, you know, two hundred in the class, and I can say you will actually have a better chance of getting a job in the Valley because of taking this class because as of about a year ago, the most sought-after job in the Valley went from a data scientist to a VR engineer. (<a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/education/stanford-virtual-reality-class-puts-students-in-metaverse">Bellini,</a> 2024, para 12)</span></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>The VR-based learning resulted in greater presence, enjoyment, motivation, and transfer (Han &amp; Bailenson, 2024). However, within the course, all was not well. Video clips from the class showed learners struggling to control their avatars (Bailenson, 2021) and attending class just to stand around in circles (Bellini, 2021).</span></div>
<div>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gOLI_OIV3nc?si=jv2LF-d4Dz8sIZsf" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>In spite of the boasting, published reports illuminated problems with onboarding learners to the VR headset experience, unexpected software updates, and sudden platform shutdowns (Han &amp; Bailenson, 2024).¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>The instructional design was described as <strong><i>learning by doing</i></strong>, but the syllabus showed a majority of outside-of-virtual-world writing and quiz items. Within the immersive environment, there were required weekly discussion sessions (Han et al., 2022) and one project where learners could import 3D (three-dimensional) objects to make a unique VR environment. My translation? That's not much doing, actually, as it relates to being a "virtual person".¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Much to the professors‚Äô astonishment, one group of learners made a mock fake moon landing production set (Brown et al., 2023). For the course instructors, this suddenly raised the specter that immersive experiences can create false depictions or fake memories, a topic that will be revisited in the ethical labyrinths section of this series.</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">In Part 3, I'll share another example of boom and bust from the immersive environments-for-education market.<br><br></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Post-publication edit:</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>They say there is no editor like the "Publish" button and that makes me laugh because you DO spot errors after something has been published.¬† But in this case, it's not an error that I want to address, I want to add more depth and context to this post. Since it's my blog, I can. This work was previously planned to be a book chapter and as such, I held my tongue on some of my more pointed criticism and images. But here, I can lay out things more directly.<br></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Directly I am pointing to the </span>Communication 166/266:<span style="font-family: helvetica;">Virtual People course as a poor design from an instructional designer's point of view. I have studied the syllabus and read several articles and watched videos produced about the course.¬† You can read <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/downloads/comm166" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the syllabus yourself!</a></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>What I can't find is how many credits the course was. Just guessing from the workload in the syllabus, I'd guess 2 credits.¬† Could be 3 but it also could be 1. I severely doubt it's 4. <br><br>Where do I get the platform to critique this course?<br><br>1. I have 14 years full time experience teaching online. Until ~2034, there are very few that can match me with that kind of full time online teaching experience. Bailenson's class was arguably not "online" by definition (it happened in June 2021 or so and that would be post-shutdown), but it appears to have happened entirely remotely with the exception of picking up the headsets. So I can claim some expertise about what SHOULD happen with digital-based, if not online, instruction.<br>2. My doctorate is in Instructional Design specifically *for Online Learning*. So I've spent my time focusing on that.<br>3. My research focus was and is learning in immersive environments (hence this article series).<br>4. Uniquely, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-taught-one-earths-first-courses-oculus-quest-2-heather-dodds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I ALSO taught a course using the Meta Quest 2s</a> which had a similar "survey" type of design. So what Bailenson did by visiting topics each week briefly is NOT part of my critique.<br><br>Three things are my main concerns here:</span></p>
<h4 style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br><strong>1. Video clips show a ridiculous amount of on-boarding malarkey.¬†</strong> </span></h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Said another way, bringing learners into a 3D environment, not acclimating them to this and then bringing in various models and just letting the users play is nice for an introduction. It does NOT make a course and certainly it does not argue for a widespread use of the technology.<br><br>I'm sure that in one version of the video, I could hear learners over and over again gathered in small groups supposedly "doing" something in VR only to hear "can anyone hear me?" as a COMMON statement. Take my word for it; a class filled <i>from beginning to end</i> with learners not being able to hear or be heard does not count for much learning.<br></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">My point: there isn't evidence that anything other than some "visits" to VR happened.¬† And yet, over and over, this flagship course (my phrase) has learners that can't walk, can't wave, cannot follow instructions and (I guess) can't hear instructions. After week one, the learners *should* be on-boarded, all practiced up and ready to do harder things. 'Just walk over here for a group photo' should not feel like a nearly impossible task-- but the videos sure do make it look like it was.¬† <br><br>I had to giggle üòÑ because in that "all class" photo, there is one avatar in 2D, not in a headset, because they don't have hands and their movement is all 2D-type, and they are the only one that looks "logical" in their behaviors.<br><br>2.<strong> Bailenson really shows his excitement¬† </strong></span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">(in the somewhat unprofessional video) <strong>but also the "un-put-togetherness" of this experience </strong>with the his statement: <br><br></span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">I can now stand up in front of all my students and there's, you know, two hundred in the class, and I can say you will actually have a better chance of getting a job in the Valley because of taking this class because as of about a year ago, the most sought-after job in the Valley went from a data scientist to a VR engineer.

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>I find it VERY hard to believe that this one course at the 100 and 200 level will lead to 200 new VR engineer's getting jobs in "the Valley".¬† Insert hard eyeroll here. üôÑ¬† It looks extra bravado-y when he phrases it as "I can now stand up" as if he's really planning to do this or HAS done it.¬† It's a brag.¬† No humble about it.¬† Last I checked, the Valley wants to hire computer scientists, who should be in calculus class at the same time as this headset romp. Fact check: The Valley has been laying off VR teams.¬† So how's that 'better chance of getting a job' brag going for ya?<br><br>3. <strong>The learn-by-doing quote gets under my skin </strong>as an instructional designer. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Learn WHAT by doing WHAT, in this case? His students had to use pre-existing 3D models included in the ENGAGE platform (OK, fine-- but note that I didn't see ANY examples of models beyond ones we've already seen in ENGAGE advertising) to build a scene that was basically their final project.¬†</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">(Again, disclosure: my students final project was a video mock-up of an immersive experience that they would design, if they could. The course taught no programming skills.)¬†</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">So OK, it's fine that learners can't program after 1 course. Totally understood. But then the learners put together a final project scene that sounds like Bailenson's team spit out their coffee over...J. Brown source described the team experience as, "jarring" and wanted to coin a new phrase, "mis-experience."¬† What the phrase? Garbage in, garbage out?¬† You don't design a compelling course and the results surprise you?¬† Sigh.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">It appears that they took the "made lemonade from lemons" approach. Note that I haven't mentioned ANYTHING about comparative learning outcomes related to this heralded course. Because there isn't any data on that. Not like there should be, but the research is remarkably silent ü§´ on that. <br><br>Also fact check on this: the Meta Quest 2 headsets are officially OUT of support and sale from Meta. So they are, as of this writing, outdated. I wonder how it's going over there at Stanford. Do they just ring up Mark and ask for 266 more headsets in the Meta Quest 3 type now?<br><br>I haven't mentioned, (actually I left it OUT), how much ENGAGE got free advertising from this mess. That's because they are really the main characters in the NEXT episode.<br><br></span></p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This article begins a new series where I intend to continue to bust myths related to learning in immersive environments while also advocating for research-based decisions related to instructional design.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>Now if that sounded like gobbly-gook, this might not be the series for you. But, for anyone with an interest in virtual worlds, the metaverse, or even a simple 2D simulation and the uses of these for education, this is the RIGHT place for you. <br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This is an updated version of my original 8-part Instructional Design in the Metaverse series. (Did you miss that? Here's my <a href="https://youtu.be/Rr4dzKLPlpQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 minute explainer video</a>.) I estimate that I have at least 15 parts right now to start this series and new research comes in every day. However, t</span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">his being my blog, I intend to spill a little more tea here than I do in other places.</span><br><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>Buckle up buttercups</span>!<hr></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>A wondrous thing happens the first time a learner steps into the metaverse; the learner enters a land of digital imagination. The immersive technology creates and presents what the learner senses visually and auditorily. Because those experiences are digital creations, the possibilities can be as varied and broad as human imagination. This wide open promise of anything anywhere has attracted educators and researchers for more than two decades. Within the body of research generated from this attraction, significant challenges remain for those interested in the prudent application of the immersive learning design.<br><br>The global virtual reality (VR) industry is forecast to reach $435 billion in United States dollars within the next 6 years, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 27% (Yahoo Finance, 2023). Immersive or extended reality (XR) technologies are broad combinations of computer technology that overlays or fully surround the learner with digitally constructed sights, sounds, smell, taste, pressure, heat, and texture sensations (Ziker et al., 2021). XR as a broad term is understood to encompass virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). Immersive experiences stand distinct as an educational media choice due to the factors of immersion, embodiment, and presence that arise within the learner (Southgate, 2020). This series will use the term immersive experiences to refer to the inclusive concept of learning within virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, cross reality, transmedia, and the metaverse. <br><br>Immersive experiences are expected to expand within the next few years in the areas of education, industrial training, and healthcare where the influence of instructional design could be beneficial. Educators have already been turning to immersive experiences for uses such as simulation, training, providing access to limited resources and to bridge distances as a form of remote learning (Kavanaugh et al., 2017). New educators and designers, however, often express a sense of being overwhelmed at the idea of designing instruction that would essentially be spherical (as in, surrounding the learner) and containing infinite potential (immersive experiences could contain any information or process). Unquestioningly, everyone feels that the design work is complex. <br><br>Regardless, there are still educators who, despite sudden platform shutdowns and expensive contracts, feel that immersive experiences have 'enormous unrealized potential‚Äô (Wecker, 2014). The complexity of designing for the metaverse calls for assistance from instructional design that focuses on ‚Äúinstructional methods, specific features that facilitate actual learning‚Äù (Honebein &amp; Reigeluth, 2023. p. 292). Unfortunately, heretofore immersive experiences have precipitated haphazard designs lacking guidance:<br><br></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Education researchers borrow heavily from the entertainment designers, who focus on engagement, and not necessarily on retention of content. The dearth of studies highlights the urgency for a set of guidelines for designing content that allows users to make appropriate choices in a spherical space. (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018, p. 7)</span></p>

</a></div>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Therefore, this series will begin with looking at the current state of immersive experiences for learning research. Published research however, often falls short of the mark. This series will contribute to both fundamental and practical applications (Shi &amp; Evans, 2023), landing in Pasteur‚Äôs Quadrant as Mayer (2020) suggested, as ‚Äúbasic research in applied situations‚Äù (p. 22). This series draws from the body of published research in the form of a selective consumer; it discriminates seeking to understand the wise applications of immersive environments. Additionally, it addresses real problems faced by instructional designers and administrators. Staying grounded in reality will be very important as we journey into the research of virtual worlds.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">We will begin with some history, next post.</span></p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">At this point, we have all of the building blocks ready to begin a design. We know what works from 2D learning and what to try with 3D learning. Beginning the steps to launch an XR experience can feel more like a User Experience (UX) project than an instructional design project, however. UX similarly uses storyboards, journey mapping, and personas which can be very helpful in designing emotion into the experience. Prototype versions can be ready for a few users to sample and give feedback. Overall, ID projects in the metaverse feel different because the designing and building phases <i>blend together</i> with test layouts requiring adjustment.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Even at the final project launch, instructional designers (IDs) should observe how the learners are experiencing the design. IDs should be at the forefront with the learners, constantly evaluating what is working and what is not. It can be very helpful for IDs to observe what learners try first or how they explore the experience. In this way, design with this media is less of a one-way instance and more of an ongoing process. Remember <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PXRJEAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=UpbIsA4SJU&amp;dq=learning%20experience%20design%20Clark&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">D.

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Appreciating Michelangelo‚Äôs artistic style</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Let‚Äôs say the instructor wants to emphasize<strong> viewing the artwork within the chapel, on the curved ceiling and the soaring upper walls and how this viewing angle intersects with perspective</strong>.

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In XR, designers could use either or both. The learners might be able to first view the artwork from the floor and then <strong>fly</strong> and compare looking at the art from mid-air. In this way, the learners will have comparative viewing from different angles‚Ä¶something that the real life Chapel can not easily provide. This satisfies the instructor's request to focus on the viewing experience by providing a standard replication and then a different angle as comparison.¬†</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">By thinking about the learner‚Äôs experience, the designer can start to list which aspects of the real world need to be replicated (e.g., gravity, enclosed space) and which aspects will not be from reality (e.g. flying on demand). In summary, <strong>this adage fits: begin with the end in mind.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For XR designs, ask ‚Äúwhat is the feeling that you want your learner to have?‚Äù That might come as a surprise‚Äì elevating feeling as a primary design priority.

<blockquote class="article-editor-content__blockquote">
<blockquote><strong>Emotional coinage works in XR storytelling because emotion transcends language;</strong> it does not need a text pop-up or an AI translator.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">When an emotion can be relayed in some sort of visual or sound media, the designer can worry less about language translation or exactness in the metaverse. XR works naturally in this realm. Combining emotion with narrative plot creates designs where the learner is truly at the center because the learner becomes the lead character in the story. They are pulled along the learning journey because their character (their avatar) is experiencing the story.¬†</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In planning a design, IDs can ask the instructor what the main emotion is that they want their learners to feel within the space (curiosity, happiness, fear, proficiency, etc.).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The emotions can, of course, change as the story changes. In prototypes, IDs should ask learners what feelings they have in the XR space. Does the feeling match the purpose/goal? If not, the design needs to be changed to foster the emotion that is intended.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3 Real World Correlation</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">After the purpose is established and the central emotions are noted for a learning experience, the ID can determine how much of a real world correlation there is to the XR experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For instance, when coming up against a design challenge in XR, IDs should ask, ‚ÄúHow is this done in the real world?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The answer might be that the learner does a behavior (e.g. takes notes or alters a piece of equipment) or retrieves more information (e.g. looks at a reference source). With some consideration, the real world solution can be strategized together with the Multimedia Principles and created in XR. For example, if learners are struggling to remember a series of steps, do they need a nearby poster as a visual aid? If learners are getting something wrong with timing, do they need a stopwatch or clock? In XR, posters and clocks do not need to necessarily <i>hang on walls</i>.¬†</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi22vDEFrTPHixDsS5V2xQlYId8EbhlZ5hbNTeroaxQCL2ACVHs0MZgniZ4Go9csTPnnCda-aSF24a0E-W9vt0Gxij68JM2iN_JTnt9x8_kQcyw2iFGlxGZewbCH9IL0rvPbq4Cy0ZvzmRTmjzTzzErj8Rt7WolpjC5_3uc2E5BVgLvJAf4bak-L-Lius4/w400-h206/Screenshot%202023-10-17%20124529.png" alt="Timer appears in the upper left corner, but it could be placed anywhere, or appear on demand." width="400" height="206" border="0" data-original-height="749" data-original-width="1454" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Capture from a rabbit counting experience. The timer appears in the upper left corner indicating 33 seconds left. Timers and clocks can be placed anywhere in XR.¬†</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Combining what we already know from the Multimedia Principles will maximize the opportunity to learn <strong>by placing the relevant information when and where the learner will need it.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Starting with real world correlations is the healthy first step, but next, the IDs should consider <strong>what affordances</strong> XR can further provide. For example, do the learners need to fly or go inside an object? XR easily provides the ability to go through what would be solid objects like walls. Referring to a prior example, if a learner needs access to a clock, can a floating one be put into the learner's field of view, but not necessarily on a wall or wrist? By imagining the experience in pieces or segments, an ID can deconstruct what is necessary to drive the experience along and then rebuild those segments with the added possibilities of 3D design.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Here is another example: an experience is replicating a spacewalk in outer space. The learning objective is to have the learner follow the correct procedure despite stressful conditions. The learner needs to put on a space suit following the correct procedure and check it for safety before leaving the spaceship. The emotional tone is to be calm and methodical even if the situation is urgent. What is the real world correlation to this experience? It might be donning protective equipment at a cold weather research station. This is a cognitively correlated event; the thought process is very similar. Thus, we can use this real world event to drive the design of the XR event. Items need to be put on in a certain order and checked for safety before going outside.¬†</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The XR design might want to include an alarm sound or flashing light to create urgency. Some sort of ‚Äòbuddy check‚Äô system might stand by so that after the learner puts on the equipment, it is checked by another entity. Including alarms and safety checks are correlations to real world elements that can be built into the experience<i>.</i> The details of surrounding walls and floors or what is happening outside the spaceship do not influence this learning event. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayer</a> (2020) refers to these as <strong>seductive details</strong> ‚Äì interesting, but they detract from the learning. Therefore, those details can be minimized in the surrounding design.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">A learner could learn from a book how to enter a store and buy something. A learner could also learn from entering a real store and buying something. Both are ways to complete the learning, but the designs‚Äì that is, how to structure the learning from start to finish, will be different. The book is analogous to direct instruction. There are times when direct instruction will be the better approach. The real store is analogous to experiential learning. There are times when experiential learning will be the better approach. The approaches are different; there is no inherently better approach for all situations.¬†¬†</p>

Learners engage in making meaningful connections when words and pictures align during experiences. Meaning is also deeply embedded in the storytelling approach, where it is often the journey that the protagonist goes through that remains memorable long after a story has ended. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PXRJEAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=UpbIsA4SJU&amp;dq=learning%20experience%20design%20Clark&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. Clark</a> argued, ‚Äúlearning experiences are exactly that, experiences designed to change us, specifically our long term memories‚Äù (2022, p. 7). Further, D. Clark advocated for a balanced use of storytelling, explaining that it can bring life to dry information, but should not be overused and wander into a ‚ÄúDisneyfication of learning as entertainment‚Äù (2022, p. 7). Lastly, D. Clark argued that stories for learning should be designed as ‚Äúalways beginnings, never ends-in-themselves‚Äù if the learning is to be applicable beyond the experience, into the ‚Äúlong tail of practice, transfer, and performance‚Äù (2022, p. 7).</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Indeed, the storytelling approach in learning pulls the learner through the experience. To use storytelling, the learner should experience a flow through their experience, a beginning and middle of the story. The end could happen in XR or more substantially outside of XR into desired application. The learning experience <strong>should be planned and not haphazard.</strong> Learners should be guided on a planned route. XR storytelling can be first person or group experiences. Regardless, each learner is a protagonist; their decisions determine what they will experience. Recalling the constructivist learning theory foundation, what the learners <i>experience</i> becomes the learning experience that is being designed <i>for</i>. If learners are exposed to situations where they actively construct their knowledge, then the reality that the learners construct was constructed <i>by them</i>, not constructed by the media or by others. Further, learners do not arrive as empty vessels to be passively filled with information if they are the protagonists of their own learning event. Learners add, sort, emphasize, or suppress new experiences when compared to old experiences.¬† Subsequently, a learner already experienced in real life (non-XR) is bringing those experiences into XR with them. In summary, <strong>learners arrive already ready to experience a story. Thus, narrative plot or a story arc is a good approach to XR instructional design.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Plot, narrative, or narrative plot are all descriptions of phases within storytelling. There are slight variances in names but the phases generally focus on the user‚Äôs (or in our case, the learner‚Äôs) experience (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DHo3DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=mZnAwii8NJ&amp;dq=Lichaw%2C%20D.%20(2016).%20The%20user's%20journey%3A%20Storymapping%20projects%20that%20people%20love.%20New%20York%3A%20Rosenfeld%20Media&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lichaw</a>, 2016).¬†</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">These phases describe what is happening to the protagonist. In the case of XR, the learner is the star and they should be brought through these phases in an effective design plan. Table 1 compares a storytelling arc with the Pixar story arc, a story arc example of Cinderella, an XR story arc, and an XR narrative plot example.¬†</p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">Example of Narrative Plot in XR</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Introduction.</strong> The who, what, where, why, when of the experience is explained. The scene opens. This starts before the digital experience begins and lasts 30 seconds to a few minutes into the experience, depending on how much needs to be explained. This is the beginning of the exposition.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Set the scene. </strong>Provide guidance on the affordances within the experience, how to communicate, walk, navigate, where is help (e.g. where is a digital companion). The learner is invited to move, change appearance, and communicate.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Dilemma.</strong> Introduce the conflict or the scenario that the learner will participate in. The learner is presented with a challenge or problem. This is the inciting incident and rising action phases. This can be a great time to guide and practice small solutions to small problems.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Crisis.</strong> The learner must act and initiate some sort of change. It is action-oriented, and the learner is on center stage.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Change or Denouement.</strong> The results of the change have an impact on consequences or the environment. Said another way, the change ripples through the experience to change it for the learner. The results are non-trivial and not haphazard.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Resolution or End.</strong> The mission is complete, and the world has changed around the learner. The learner is living out the consequences of their decision.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Some research has shown that most of the instructional emphasis does not need to be within the XR experience itself. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/l3tw6O8Hn-s?feature=share&amp;t=1663" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dede</a> (2021), when reflecting on what he now believes after over five decades of immersive learning research, said:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">‚ÄúI used to believe that if you had resources, you should spend 95% of the resources on the immersive experience and then you just do a little thinking about what kind of induction you use before people go into immersion and what kind of post experience debriefing you do.¬† I‚Äôve come to believe now that the induction and debriefing is where the learning takes place predominantly, and so designing those is very important.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This indicates the importance of the on-boarding and the follow up experiences. The story of an experience begins before something is activated and ends long after.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>The main point of keeping a narrative plot mindset in ID XR design is to keep the learner at the center of the experience. </strong>Every step of the narrative plot approach focuses on what the protagonist- that is, the learner- experiences: dilemmas, crisis, change, etc. This approach, then, keeps the ID focused on the learner‚Äôs experience, not the technology. For example, let‚Äôs say a platform can recreate the school environment down to the desks and chairs. An ID might reason, ‚ÄòThis a great place to hold a class! I can assign classes to virtual rooms and the instructor can use web-sharing boards.‚Äô¬†</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZXncQoR6J1Wug8PH_6xKWKZyZ772q3k-w61ChXyhfwngenGGeu2UOf84fgF22mDaQ60YKCspz5N6SJFxJw39YPoKI7ZTg799qmVTW_CE1bl9bnrfgJbl8B-ztIKbX-wPeo_Ev640ahyphenhyphen0Gw0bTa0Q046FAS2sCALYMk4pP7aC7d1C-nTrmXuYGxjphUxM/w640-h354/virtual%20reality%20classroom.png" alt="Capture of a classroom in virtual reality, complete with desks, chairs, and chalkboard." width="640" height="354" border="0" data-original-height="757" data-original-width="1366" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Don't try this in VR</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">That approach puts the technology first and does not consider the learner. It also recreates the problems of regular in-person classrooms and throws in a few more virtual problems as well (i.e., poor internet connections might have avatars distractedly appearing and disappearing). Rather, a learner-centric approach might ask ‚ÄúWhat is the main experience or emotion that the instructor wants the learners to have in this lesson?‚Äù As <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayer</a> stated, ‚ÄúHow can we adapt multimedia technology to <i>aid </i>human cognition?‚Äù (2020, p. 15). This might cause the ID to look at the entire XR event differently and not recommend a virtual classroom. There is more on emotion in design in Section 5.2.</p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2 Visual and Sound Range</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For the ID, the added visual depth and sound possibilities beyond 2D must be designed. However, more to design means more risk. With XR, the added ability to put information anywhere has more risk of overwhelming the learner than helping the learner. Indeed, D. Clark (2022) agrees that Mayer‚Äôs Principles lean towards <strong>less is more</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.1 Visuals</h3>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This reflects real life. If one was working at a workstation, critical information would be within easy viewing and reach. Other information could be available in what Alger calls the Curiosity Zone ‚Äì behind and below the learner, but learners should be prompted, as in real life, by sound, light, or foreknowledge, to engage with that non-obvious space (2015).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Alger (2015) further proposes that the visual hierarchy matches the importance of information. To find information in 3D, we look at the center ahead first, then left and right, then below, then above, then finally at our own bodies. Everything above eye level is for things beyond the learner‚Äôs control like weather, time, or authority notifications. Everything at or below eye level is within the learner‚Äôs control.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">These user interface principles skew towards conservatism in detail; less is better. IDs should design minimal spaces, with prompts, and within easy arm reach. IDs can create storyboards with isomorphic qualities that both curve around the learner and contain planning space for the foreground, mid-ground, and background visuals.</p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.2 Sound</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Immersive sound is a rising field within XR design. Poor sound can ruin an XR experience. Experiences can have <strong>spatial sound</strong> where the loudness drops off over virtual distance or <strong>flat sound</strong> where the loudness is the same throughout the entire space. As much as possible, it is good accessible practice that <strong>all senses should have learner controls</strong>: brightness, sound, movement, and intensity.¬†</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">After Cosmonious High from Owlchemy Labs did some vision updates, they had over 1.53 million times users put their hand over an object to request text-to-speech--in one month and only with Quest users. Still think accessibility features are optional?</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Many platforms and experiences already contain volume controls for separate parts of the experience (e.g., voice chat, environment, or notifications all have separate volume controls). Learners should be trained on these controls at on-boarding.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhIoY1ckmx7Kp1Iz98azjJ3-l8KCAtrMSs7ogVLugIKlF1CivfuUx4hUGYtM6ll6UxkrwL9xdflfqtGjOYXNmraN-3RmepvkqrUcSxHR_-HnB1BrOGqDEnepdEkydQBp9ktx8Qm7G5b5PyMl9rTNtxfNKM0L2I3swfaYkhqUqOi1a7Va5fOwlJPsd_OtYg/w320-h270/Cosmonius%20High%20accessibility%20sound%20text.png" alt="Capture from inside Cosmonious High game showing accessibility features" width="320" height="270" border="0" data-original-height="1273" data-original-width="1509" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Cosmonious High capture of some accessibility settings.

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Generally, for information that is necessary for the learning event:</p>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">If the information is in speech, provide text equivalents (e.g., transcript).</p>
</li>
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">If the information is in sound (environmental sounds or notifications), it should have equivalent visual and/or text indicators.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">If the information is in text only, provide sound equivalents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.3 Interaction &amp; Movement</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Interactions in XR could be reaching, grabbing, and moving. Good experimental research exists from organizations like <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://ieeevr.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEEE VR</a> or <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://iui.acm.org/2024/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACM IUI</a> on 3D user interface recommendations. Alger‚Äôs (2015) design advice showed a seated avatar seated work will be more comfortable than standing in XR.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Almost every new XR user has walked their avatar into a wall. It happens.¬†</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP-w38jE54vtgDNf5mkFrPrh32EnjmGyyInAPf4oD83J0Y1K7nTaQLpBLErGZtE78uA72g-pD1zvrs8arJZXeiPTmeHavuEOH8g2VXwfNpNqeH9-WvUzjW9FkS7M2VTq1fVsMICpKAK7rqqGSU3fmGlvzrfi3wTRO_SWIwo0r6BpooU6zI8Pckc1mHVa8/w400-h308/Peter%20must%20stand%20in%20the%20corner%20after%20the%20Workshop%20meeting.png" alt="Capture of my friend Peter when he walked his avatar into a corner." width="400" height="308" border="0" data-original-height="726" data-original-width="946" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>You stay in that corner until you can act like a good avatar, Peter!</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Given that the wall isn‚Äôt real, mistakes like this are forgiven quickly. IDs can ask learners to move.¬†</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">(And Peter knew I took his picture at this moment above.)</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Movement in XR is an advantage of the metaverse. While research does not indicate that movement causes learning, it can greatly assist in the storytelling aspect of bringing a learner through an experience by requesting that the avatar move <i>through the story</i> in virtual space time.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Movement is <i>relative</i> in this media. Frame of reference can be manipulated. The avatar can move, or the avatar can stay in one place and the scenes can move or change around them. There are a LOT of <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/807-virtual-reality-games-locomotion-methods.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">choices for movement in XR</a>. From gaming research, it looks like most of the possibilities are aiming to reduce vestibular mismatch.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In this area, movement-based engagement can be an area of exploration in designs. For example, asking learners to move to one side of the room or another is an interesting way to run a poll. XR movement often includes dancing and flying. Future research should explore the use of controllers or hand detection for learning.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.4 Emojis</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Many social XR platforms have incorporated emojis and they can be used for their apparent reasons: love, happy, sad, clapping, or raised hand. Within designs, learners can use them differently, that is for feedback, poll indicators, or silent ‚ÄòI need help‚Äô indicators. Learners have been known to redefine emojis to mean whatever makes sense to them during a learning event.</p>

                <p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This conceptual series proposes instructional design principles for the metaverse. This is Part 5. Today we start the building blocks of design. And the best news for instructional designers? So much of what we already know from two-dimensional learning <strong><i>will work</i></strong> in three-dimensions. Grab your toolbox, IDs!</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading">2D to 3D: What Is the Same</h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Technology can benefit learning when the affordances are leveraged towards effective and evidence-based learning principles (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-020-09592-4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yeung, Carpenter, &amp; Corral</a>, 2021). Instructional design already has a depth of theory and research that shows that a learning experience is a ‚Äúsystemic, complex design‚Äù (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles-Reigeluth/publication/371304955_How_Do_We_Solve_a_Problem_Like_Media_and_Methods_207/links/647e04b6b3dfd73b7767f1d2/How-Do-We-Solve-a-Problem-Like-Media-and-Methods-207.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honebein &amp; Reigeluth</a>, 2023. p. 14).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Yet, instructional designers (IDs) interested in the metaverse in education can be at risk for <strong>two unhelpful mindsets</strong>: first, thinking that <strong>IDs must become developers</strong> or second, succumbing to a ‚Äò<strong>buy first, find a use for it later</strong>‚Äô mentality. The first creates a substantial learning curve with the end result mostly being scenes or environments and 3D objects. Currently, AI is able to create scenes and objects (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chandan-Kumar-Sahu/publication/348037151_Artificial_intelligence_AI_in_augmented_reality_AR-assisted_manufacturing_applications_a_review/links/5fffd7b545851553a0418910/Artificial-intelligence-AI-in-augmented-reality-AR-assisted-manufacturing-applications-a-review.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sahu, Young, &amp; Rai</a>, 2021). As a consequence, the need for programmers may decrease. The second mindset leads to IDs to search for educational resources to justify the expense and bother of entering the metaverse.¬†</p>

Technocentric-design.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Both of these mindsets <strong>miss the main point</strong> of instructional design. They sacrifice the <strong>learner-centric stance</strong> for a technology-centric stance (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayer</a>, 2020). Many of the 2D-based instructional design models, structures, and principles apply towards 3D learning (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://edtechbooks.org/id_highered/immersive_learning_e" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dodds</a>, 2021).</p>
<blockquote class="article-editor-content__blockquote">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">What we already know should inform us as we make future 3D designs because as <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://youtu.be/4o__z7aPlMw" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alger</a> stated, ‚ÄúPrinciples and processes of design are pretty universal because we're usually designing <strong><i>for humans</i></strong><i>‚Äù</i> (2020, 3:06).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">A further extension of this thought would be that IDs are not designing <i>for technology.</i> An ID focusing on 3D design for the first time can have an advantage because their experience will be from a novice‚Äôs viewpoint. Learners are novices. Thus, the ID experiences what the learners will later experience for the first time.</p>
<blockquote class="article-editor-content__blockquote">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Keeping the learner-centric point of view is key.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This section emphasizes the use of Mayer‚Äôs Principles of Multimedia Design (Mayer, 2020, pp. 400-402, [Reminder, I covered the basics in <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/instructional-design-metaverse-part-2-heather-dodds-ph-d-" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 2</a>]) because they are based on research. This list is not meant as a checklist. This is meant to remind IDs of what the correct design choice <i>would be</i> within a 3D experience.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">1 Reduce extraneous processing</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The Coherence, Signaling, Redundancy, Spatial Contiguity, and Temporal Contiguity Principles will assist in decisions about types of media (visual, text, audio) and where it will be placed or made available in XR experiences. Because of the enveloping nature of the 3D environment upon the learner, extra unnecessary material could interfere with the learning.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">1.1 Coherence</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúWeed out extraneous material‚Äù.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: Minimize text, sounds, and movement that is not directly related to the learning goal.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">1.2 Signaling</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúHighlight important material.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: Use slow pulsating glows, arrows, or narrative prompts to focus the learner on the content.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">1.3 Redundancy</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúDo not add printed text that duplicates narration.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: Accessibility concerns dictate that information available via vision or sound should be made available in an alternate form. To follow the spirit of this principle, default settings can be set to include both alternates as activated, which could then be toggled off by the learner at will. XR accessibility research organizations such as <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://xraccess.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">XR Access</a> or <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://virtualability.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Ability </a>should be consulted for further guidance.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">1.4 Spatial Contiguity</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúPlace printed text near to the corresponding part of the graphic.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: There is more space to work with in 3D than 2D. The key with this principle will be to find just the right place to put the text. Some user experience (UX) testing in the form of A/B testing can help find the best placement.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">1.5 Temporal Contiguity</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúPresent corresponding graphics and narration at the same time.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: Sound and action triggers can be timed within 3D programming.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2 Managing essential processing</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The Segmenting, Pre-training, and Modality Principles help the designer place the necessary material in the right place and time for the learner to move the content into sensory memory, short-term memory, and into long-term memory.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.1 Segmenting</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúBreak a lesson into learner-paced parts.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: Plan lessons with storyboards with scenes where the learner moves through the experience. Always provide an escape button that saves learner progress. If that is not possible, a confirmation dialog message can indicate that the learner upon re-entry will be returned to a certain spot.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.2 Pre-training</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúProvide pre-training in the names and characteristics of the key terms.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: Plan for pre- and post-experience briefing. Pre-training is analogous to reading the box when considering buying a game or reviewing choices in an online store. The learner experience <i>starts</i> there.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.3 Modality</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúPresent words in spoken form.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: Especially for key vocabulary, provide sound files of pronunciation. This especially matters if the experience is designed for solo learner use.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3 Fostering generative processing</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The Multimedia, Personalization, Voice, Image, Embodiment, Immersion and Generative Activity Principles help encourage learners to cognitively engage with the material and exert effort to make sense of it. It is this area of design where the ID is making sure that the learners are not passively accepting information <strong>but must do mental work with it</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3.1 Multimedia</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúUse corresponding words and graphics to explain the material.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: XR is a natural fit for this principle because it nearly always contains simultaneous visuals and sounds. These can be timed together within 3D programming. An interesting design exercise for IDs, however, is to isolate certain aspects of a design and think through how it might work if only one channel of input was working. For example, in a tour of XR spaces, there might be a period of a few seconds of complete darkness between scenes. How are the learners guided by sound only during this time?</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3.2 Personalization</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúPut words in conversational language.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: Recorded audio should sound comfortably natural.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3.3 Voice</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúPresent spoken words in an appealing human voice.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: This applies most logically in XR to human sources of the spoken words. Poor sound can ruin an XR experience.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3.4 Image</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúDo not put the instructor‚Äôs static image on the screen.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: The keyword in this principle is ‚Äòstatic‚Äô. This would rarely be needed in XR. Exceptions might include biographies or eulogies.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3.5 Embodiment</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúHave instructors display human-like gestures, eye contact, facial expressions, and body movements.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: The Proteus Effect shows that users change their behaviors depending on their avatars (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Goerlich/publication/347582766_How_Avatars_Influence_User_Behavior_A_Review_on_the_Proteus_Effect_in_Virtual_Environments_and_Video_Games/links/624997f421077329f2eec0f7/How-Avatars-Influence-User-Behavior-A-Review-on-the-Proteus-Effect-in-Virtual-Environments-and-Video-Games.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Praetorius, &amp; G√∂rlich</a>, 2020). Employers are becoming more interested in the use of the metaverse for meetings (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://arpost.co/2022/11/11/expressvpn-survey-immersive-tech-workplace/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaehnig</a>, 2022). It is reasonable to predict that educators will be holding meetings that are now on-campus or in Zoom with their learners in the metaverse within five years. Due to the demand for these human-like behaviors, avatar creators and platforms are adding more movements like blinking, sitting, or gesturing.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3.6 Generative Activity</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúAdd prompts to engage in generative activities such as summarizing, mapping, drawing, imagining, self-testing, self-explaining, teaching, and enacting.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: Interestingly, here the research reaches a nexus; several different sources point in the same direction. Mayer called these generative activities and points to their use <i>within the learning act</i>, as a guided form of practice, ‚ÄúInsert prompts to engage in generative learning activities within the instructional episode‚Äù and ‚Äúlearners must use the material from the lesson rather than simply remember it‚Äù (2020, p. 371). From this, an activity within XR would be ideal. However, generative activities are not exclusive to happening within XR. Wallace stated in <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://endurancelearning.com/blog/id-for-non-training-professionals/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washburn</a> (2023) that all learning points to some place in the future where the results are played out‚Äìideally in a workplace or high stakes setting; it is the final performance that counts. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/l3tw6O8Hn-s?feature=share&amp;t=1663" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dede </a>(2021) pointed out the importance of onboarding and off-boarding as where the learning occurs primarily. Mayer conceded that <strong>generative activities likely need to be taught first as behaviors before asking a learner to perform them</strong> (2020). That is, learners need to be taught what summarizing is before being asked to summarize. This is a valid and somewhat overlooked point. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PXRJEAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=UpbIsA4SJU&amp;dq=learning%20experience%20design%20Clark&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. Clark</a> referred to these activities as ‚Äúeffortful learning‚Äù or ‚Äúdesirable difficulties‚Äù (2022, p. 3) and <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.worklearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Thalheimer-The-Learning-Transfer-Evaluation-Model-Report-for-LTEM-v11.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thalheimer</a> (2006) supported retrieval practice, spaced practice, or interleaving approaches. Each of these researchers has a slightly different view into the same problem.</p>
<blockquote class="article-editor-content__blockquote">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>They seem to point to the need for a certain amount of learner effort (not just clicking), with guidance, that should occur <i>within</i> XR and then a follow-on amount of learner effort <i>after</i> leaving XR.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">What might this look like? Here, we reach the edges of known ID in the metaverse universe [Editor Heather here: fresh off the presses! This just hit ResearchGate last month: <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374151193_Collaborative_generative_learning_activities_in_immersive_virtual_reality_increase_learning" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collaborative generative learning activities in immersive virtual reality increase learning</a>], but <strong>we can take with us what we already know.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The key question to ask is: <strong>In real life</strong>, where do learners practice in place<strong><i> </i></strong>and later perform when the stakes really matter?¬† How something is done in real life should be the template that we use to start thinking of how the behavior should be prompted in the metaverse.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Here is an example: Learners do science labs in real life. They practice doing a procedure under the watchful eye of an instructor. It is usually fine if they fail because they can start again but there is some risk and limitation of resources. In XR, the same lab can be set up as practice where learners can repeat interactions, control the speed, and engage in plausible manipulations of scientific equipment (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.idpublications.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Full-Paper-THE-EFFECT-OF-VIRTUAL-LABORATORY-ON-STUDENT-TEACHERS%E2%80%99-ACHIEVEMENT-IN-INTEGRATED.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asare, Annan, &amp; Ngman-Wara</a>, 2022). The scripted practice available within XR should be added to other generative activities which could be inside and/or outside of XR such as learners self-explaining what is happening in the experiment during a video recording of the experience or learners teaching what would happen if the variables changed or if there was a chemical spill.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">3.7 Immersion</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Summary: ‚ÄúDo not convert lessons into 3D immersive virtual reality.‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">ID: At this point, this article series would appear to come to a stop.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This last principle basically states do not use 3D. This article series posits, do use 3D, if it is the right thing to do. Returning to the beginning assumptions:</p>
<ol class="article-editor-content__ordered-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Learners experience the virtual as real.</p>
</li>
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Learning outcomes are expected to be equal to other media.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">It goes to follow, therefore, that if the designs will be accepted by the learners as real experiences and if the learning outcomes are the same as for other forms of media, the decision to go forward with the design should only occur <strong>if the lesson cannot reasonably be done in 2D and meets at least one of the conditions of saving time, money, or danger.</strong> Stepping outside of the learning objective decision, one could argue that 3D allows for added immersion and presence. But in that case, the ID should ask ‚ÄúIs immersion or presence<i> critical to the learning objective</i>?‚Äù</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Acknowledging the affordance of immersion, Mayer pointed out that the case for immersion is often wrapped into the learner's feelings of interest and motivation (2020, p.361). The logic goes that if a learner is motivated, they will learn more. Research shows that interest and motivation wane and learning performance drains away with it.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The case for presence can be tied with a personal feeling of being there. The more a learner takes on the experience as real and really happening to them, the more the learning should stick with them. Contrarily, research shows that distraction due to extraneous processing seems to cancel any benefit that might be gained (Mayer, 2020). <strong>In sum, the research does not predict at this time that presence will increase learning.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Finally, this tidbit might tip the scales for a decision. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=v1uzCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;ots=TNCJkGdMdm&amp;dq=clark%20mayer&amp;lr&amp;pg=PR17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clark and Mayer</a> recommended this strategy from e-learning: ‚ÄúUse facilitative techniques that support social presence‚Äù (2016, p. 313). This tips the balance of synchronous versus asynchronous learning towards synchronous and shows an affordance <i>not before mentioned:</i> the benefit of social learning in XR.</p>
<blockquote class="article-editor-content__blockquote">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Wise uses of XR seem to contain elements <i>of bringing learners together</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This should be leaned into in designs, if possible. Therefore, if learning designs can minimize extraneous processing and are best done in 3D, next we should ask what is different about <i>designing</i> for 3D.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">That will be Part 6. Stay tuned!</p>
