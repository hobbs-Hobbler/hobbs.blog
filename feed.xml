                <p>With the results of the United States Presidential Election in November 2024, there was a tectonic shift in the thinking of individuals that do want to speak truth to power, but also do not want to be unwise in the act. My blog is primarily about speaking the truth about XR for learning around and despite some very powerful companies and a few personal enemies.<br><br>I'm old enough that the lessons of World War II are not lost on me.  The time period between November 2024 and this blog going live in June/July 2025 has caused many to harken of 1920s Germany. Indeed, several new phrases have been circulating in my head.<br><br><a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/twenty-lessons-read-by-john-lithgow" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Do not obey in advance</a> is one.<br><br>But another idea is <strong>to not give up my data</strong>, even if I'm utilizing my free speech rights as a US citizen. The idea that one would not be caught up in being arrested or worst <em>if</em> one is doing nothing wrong...is behind us. The monster eats and it eats anyone it can get.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p><br>That idea lead me to the lovely <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Opt Out Project blog</a>.<br><br>Even though I had no direct reason for jumping ship from blogger/blogspot...how MUCH big tech is scraping personal accounts for data now just friggin scares me.  I left Twitter/X because of their new policy so take anything anyone posts as food for their AI.  I create and share my creations. I was like...uh, no, you are not free to take my stuff.  So I left, deleting everything in my wake.</p>

It took me 4 months to get this blog up and running.  To the best of my ability, here is what it does.<br><br>1. <strong>I don't care about number counting reads</strong>. Read counts stoke vanity. I've also never activated replies to my posts. If you want to respond, do so on your own blog, thankyouverymuch. 🧐 I try very hard to not count nor look at the numbers of anything I create.  It's not. about. the. numbers. 🚫🔢<br><br>2. This blog is hosted on Github Pages, which is at this time a Microsoft product. <strong>I encourage you to visit using a VPN</strong> because they are probably tracking IPs, but I do not receive the information. <strong>I do not have ANY analytics</strong> that I have activated on this blog.  <br><br>3. I'm using Publii and since I only post blog posts and nothing else (no stores, no forms, no mailing lists...I guess the kids call this static HTML now) <strong>I do not plan on adding ANY plugins</strong>. I'm using a basic theme available from Publii.  I'll let you know here and in the cookie banner if that changes in the future.<br><br>4. I'm going to attempt to set up the cookie banner to be meaningless for collecting anything and to strongly encourage you to Reject cookies. Let's hope I figure that out.</p>
<p>Oh and one more thing, <strong>I do not monetize anything here</strong>. Nothing.  By willingly turning my back on all forms of monetization, I'm never working for someone else that will show up as bias in my writing.<br><br>As Opt Out Project writes: <strong>No trackers. No fingerprints. No data collection.</strong><br><br>Let us all live long and prosper.</p>

<p id="7d41" class="pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The basic idea here is that whenever tragedy or death occurs, the person closest emotionally to the event (I’ll call them ‘the bereaved’) gets TO HAVE EVERY EMOTION THEY WANT. Yes, this is important. That person can be sad, happy, angry, in denial, relieved, or fearful. That person gets to <strong class="mg gx">emote out</strong> (dump out) any emotion they want for as long as they want.</p>

<p id="7288" class="pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, immediately around the bereaved is likely family (spouse, children, siblings). Their <strong class="mg gx">care in</strong> duties will often be the most personal and direct but also the most hidden and quiet. They may help pick out clothing for the body. They can stay with the bereaved until a few days have passed, making sure that the bereaved can do things like eat, drink, and sleep.</p>
<p id="e66e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The next outer circle might contain the children’s bosses at their place of employment, who care in by granting as much bereavement leave as possible. Churches often are in this circle too and they can arrange meal delivery or communicate prayer requests. Circles further out are societal structures of updating paperwork or processing a death certificate.</p>
<p id="e668" class="pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">What should NOT happen is mixing the emoting out and caring in.</p>
<p id="135a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">So <strong class="mg gx">DO NOT EMOTE IN.</strong></p>
<p id="12b6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Examples of emoting in include cruel statements like: “You should be glad he is with our Lord” or “It is blessing that you don’t have to worry about his constant care anymore.” That is pouring an emotion in. No. Never do that. You have no right. <strong class="mg gx">NO EMOTION IN </strong>towards the center. No level can <em>emote in</em> to a level that is closer to the center.</p>
<p id="d978" class="pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Also, you can’t expect the bereaved to send care out. This is not the time to ask them to make your favorite cake. It’s just not right.</p>
<p id="038d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Now, each person gets to play a role in grieving. Just because a spouse is the center of her circle over the death of her husband doesn’t mean that each child will also be the center of their own circles over the death of their father. So the circles do overlap. The point is to recognize who is closer the rawness of death and cede the emotional center to them <em class="ny">at that moment</em>.</p>
<p id="4f27" class="pw-post-body-paragraph me mf gw mg b mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb gp bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">I offer this advice as someone for whom death has been a companion. I’ve lost many treasured family members over the past 15 years and learned that grief is not like a wave that you stand up from, recover, brush yourself off, and look ahead. <em><strong>You don’t get over it. </strong></em>You get changed by it. Grief is a like yeast to bread; it works it's way into every part of the loaf. Grief changes you and makes you see perspective.</p>

Life changes. Sweetness arrives again in birdsong or a child’s laughter. Pain subsides like the tide pulling away. You will begin to fear death less when you realize that we are all together in this journey.</p>
