                <p><span style="font-family: arial;">The next myth is that learning in immersive experiences is active, kinesthetic, or like an internship, which is ‚Äúthe way most people learn best‚Äù (D‚ÄôAgostino, 2022, para 17.) Spoiler: no it is not.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Active learning was first associated with immersive experiences because learners could observe or engage with or, more properly described, engage within simulations (Dede, 2009). The term active simply meant that the learner was present at a simulated place and time; the original use of the active learning phrase with reference to immersive experiences did not imply that a learner could do anything other than observe. The emphasis was much more on the time and space travel afforded by XR.<br><br>This claim has been controversial (Khorasani et al., 2023), in part because of the differing degrees of activity that a learner can have - ranging from simply being inside an immersive environment and observing (e.g. historical re-enactment simulations) to taking actions that have non-trivial consequences (e.g. practicing a surgical technique).<br><br></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Active learning is a phrase on the move</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Dede (2009) referred to <strong>actional immersion</strong> as situations where learner actions have ‚Äúnovel, intriguing consequences‚Äù that are ‚Äúhighly motivating and sharply focus attention.‚Äù (p. 66). The active learning claim moved from a focus on the <strong><i>learner‚Äôs actions</i></strong> and instead focused on the <strong><i>learner‚Äôs body ownership</i></strong> illusion. Further, the relationship between user bodies and virtual depictions (avatars) was reformulated and later called <strong>implicit learning</strong> (Slater, 2017, p. 29). <br><br>I want to pause here and really dissect the difference because in this area, there has definitely been vocabulary "drift".¬† Learner's actions focus on what the learner causes to happen.¬† Learner's body ownership focuses on parts of the body that the learner uses to cause actions.<br><br>For example, picture a chemistry lab simulation. </span></p>

They are using a mouse and moving their hand generally right to left.¬† No hand needs to be visible to do these actions. Activities could be "ghost like" in that they could be caused by no visual physical object whatsoever.¬† In reality, the computer mouse is doing the most physical 'work'.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Focusing on the <strong>learner's body ownership</strong> however, would have the learner reaching out (they need to be able to reach) to the pipette, to grab it (they need to be able to firmly grasp), to possible depress the button on the top to create the needed suction, to move the pipette, see the liquid and subsequent vial, and depress the button to dispense the liquid. The movements could be all right to left. Key in this visual depiction, however, is A HAND with workable fingers that is somehow connection via experience to a learner's IRL hand.<br><br><br>In the former example, the learner causes the actions to occur but we are not focused on their body parts doing the action. In the latter example, we are very interested in the body parts doing work that is replicate (in this case) to the real world work of operating a pipette. In the former, we could have confidence that a learner is exposed to the cause and effect of pipette work; it sucks up a reliable amount of liquid and can squirt it back out. In the latter, we could have confidence that a learner is exposed to how pipettes physically work (button press down equal prime for suck, release equals suck, button press down again equals squirt).¬† <br><br>See that the focus is different?<br><br>My point is that the FOCUS of what was coming to be called <strong><i>active learning</i></strong> with reference to XR was changing already between 2009 and 2017.</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Drawing from the educational history of the Montessori method and considering the interfaces available within immersive experiences, implicit bodily learning (from 2017) transformed to <strong>embodied learning</strong> (by 2018). Indeed, Johnson-Glenberg initially postulated that ‚Äúdoing actual physical gestures in a virtual environment should have positive, and lasting, effects on learning in the real world‚Äù (2018, p. 1). <i>Movement became synonymous with active learning</i>. ‚ÄúActive, motor-driven concepts may stimulate distributed semantic networks (meaning), as well as the associated motor cortices which would have been used to learn long ago, in childhood‚Äù (Johson Glenberg, 2018 p. 3). [Hat tip, by the way to all research into the mind-body connection within learning. This post throws no shade on the phenomena.] With specific, other than meaningful, actions now excluded, some researchers appeared to support the claim that all movement somehow begets learning. (That sentence is confusing, I wrote it and even I'm wondering what I meant. It's this: Inside a XR-for-learning experience, a learner might be instructed to do something. Pick this up, move it there.¬† Because that learning is specific to the learning event, I'm setting it aside. It's not part of this argument.¬† What I am referring to are the learner-instigated but non-instructed movements. Let's say, a learner joins XR and wanders to the left for 2 minutes before a lesson begins. Or let's say instead of looking to the "front" at the end of the experience, the learner is looking to the "back". These random but learner-instigated actions are...wait for it...somehow the secret sauce of learning in XR.¬† I kid you not. I really try to pin down the meaning from educators that belief this myth and THIS is what they come up with; because you can move in XR, you are learning (more) in XR.<br></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Did you catch that? Aren't the emperor's new clothes splendid?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">By incorporating the word ‚Äúactive‚Äù educators are reminded of the belief that active learning is better than passive learning (Slater, 2017). Ooo! Shade thrown there, for sure, because no teacher wants to be accused of being a passive educator.<br><br></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[BTW, there is reams of garbage research out there for anyone looking for a topic. Go ahead and dig into active versus passive in educational psychology papers. It's almost as big of a research garbage dump as XR; teachers radically redefine and appeal to this topic. My point is that the appeal to "active learning" when coupled with XR provides scant evidence of such. To this day, I RARELY see active learning in XR.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>Let's bear down now. To be specific, the 'active learning' coupling with 'XR' claim is not about being fidgety, randomly moving about, or purely reacting as a user would in a game. It is movement, usually performed by the learner via an avatar or minimally via hand controllers where the learner is autonomously and purposely manipulating content.¬† This is known as embodiment or embodied learning (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018; Markowitz et al., 2018) although definitions of embodiment vary. The definitions vary including how much a learner is embodied. It should also be noted that the term<i> embodiment</i> is often used interchangeably with ‚Äòembodied learning‚Äô, which is a theory that the meaningful gestures in and with the environment aid a learner‚Äôs cognitive processes (that's the no shade thing I referred to earlier). But even 'embodiment' and 'embodied learning' are slightly different things. Whew! Keeping up?<br></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Emperor's clothes <em>should be</em> splendid </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>In 2018, Johnson-Glenberg claimed that presence and embodiment were ‚Äúprofound affordances‚Äù of immersive environments and this embodiment affordance should facilitate learner control, also known as agency (p. 1). One further hat tip to Mina: she did actually use a somewhat scientific body action in her research --I believe it was catching butterflies with a butterfly net-- something that biologists WOULD do with their bodies. So it's a real world action.¬† I point this out because some XR actions are nonsensical. I'm looking at you people who change vocabulary words to bouncing balls or something.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But aren't</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>A follow-up paper by Mina, however, found that while embodiment does have a connection to learning, it does not exclusively cause learning, or perhaps better said,<strong> it doesn't interact with learning</strong>. Referring to high or low embodied VR and the connection to learning, ‚Äúplatform is not destiny‚Äù (Johnson‚ÄêGlenberg et al., 2021, p. 20). So in lay talk that means it had no effect.</span></p>

Because active learning is considered better than passive learning, claims are made that immersive experiences must cause more learning due to the body-movement connection. The research, however, does not support that claim.<br><br>The active learning myth appears to be referred to more often in academic literature than evidence to the contrary. It is true that immersive experiences can allow for more movement-based learning experiences than other forms of media, but it is not definitive that immersive experiences cause learning simply because they can contain learner movement or agency.</span></p>

<h1>Myth: Learners learn more in immersive experiences</h1>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>This¬†<span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">myth shrouds itself within a cloak of research. Citations will state that learning in immersive experiences is somehow greater when pitted against an <i>implied</i> traditional learning approach. The claim could appear as retention, but it is related to how well the learning was accomplished when measured up against learning objectives or a final goal.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">When referring to the PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC) report results mentioned earlier in this article series, Scott Likens claimed, ‚ÄúWe found the realism and performance feedback in virtual reality simulations helped people learn faster and retain more information around soft skills,‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 9). He claimed they <strong>retained more information</strong>. This specific claim has been <i>repeated</i> in academic literature, which stated, ‚ÄúStudies have found that students who use XR training are more engaged with the content, display more confidence with the material, and retain more information than students who use traditional training methods.‚Äù (Rode, 2024, para 2.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">A close examination of the PwC report, however, reveals that the claim was unsupported within the report‚Äôs own data. When comparing information retention in VR versus an e-learning course, the authors ‚Äúquickly discovered retention scores were inconclusive, as the delta between pre-and post-assessments in each modality was not significant‚Äù (Eckert &amp; Mower, 2020, p. 44). Thus, there was no statistical difference between VR-based, e-learning, and traditional classroom learning.</span></p>

<p>The r<span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">eport therefore does not provide statistical evidence of more or greater learning within VR, yet it has been cited in academic publications (O'Dwyer, 2021, Etienne et al., 2022,¬† Jelki et al., 2022; B√§ckelin, 2023; Etienne et al., 2023; L√∏nne et al,. 2023) and touted in media outlets (Murad, 2023; Schwantes, 2020). For the dubious claims, the report has been debunked as untrustworthy (Neelen &amp; Kirschner, 2020).¬†</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">There are similar claims about greater learning retained from immersive experiences. Advocates for digital twin campus environments claimed that they ‚Äúcreate greater retention of the information that is learned‚Äù (D‚ÄôAgustino, 2022, para. 5) and ‚Äústudents' grades go up‚Äù (Victory XR, 2024, Who We Are).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">In another example, the CEO of the Miami Children‚Äôs Health System touted that learners had 80% retention after one year after using VR, but traditional learners had 20% retention. A close look at the supporting documentation shows that the CEO actually said that the difference between VR learners and traditional learners can be the 80% to 20% difference.¬†</span></p>

The CEO explained their claim by saying that, ‚ÄúThe level of understanding through VR is great because humans are primarily visual, and VR is a visual format‚Äù (Gaudiosi, 2021, para. 4).

Some claims are extreme. One keynote speaker, Alvin Graylin, speaking as a leader at HTC (a VR headset maker) declared that as a result of VR use in the classroom, ‚ÄúEvery single child has the potential to be a genius‚Äù (Educators in VR, 2020, 23:33).</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Justification for the greater learning or retention claims seems to be conjecture. Claims refer to how real an immersive experience feels to a learner. Returning to the PwC report, Likens credited ‚Äúthe realism and performance feedback‚Ä¶helped people..retain more information.‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 9). But <strong>long term studies measuring retention are hard to find</strong> within the body of academic literature. Some studies measure retention three weeks after the immersive experiences. Given that many of the examples of immersive experiences relate to hands-on disciplines like nursing or construction, things learned in immersive experiences would be needed on the job more than three weeks after the training.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Hamilton et al. (2020) stated that finding ‚Äúlearning outcomes, intervention characteristics, and assessment measures associated with immersive virtual reality has been sparse‚Äù (p. 1). Beck, Morgado, and O‚ÄôShea (2023) pointed out that details of methods are missing so that outcomes become questionable, ‚ÄúVery few literature reviews focus on the educational practices and strategies used in immersive learning environments. Thus, the problem is that we are evaluating outcomes without a comparable way to describe the educational approaches that led to those outcomes‚Äù (p. 2). Lawson et al. (2024) completed a systematic review of immersive experiences and found that research studies rarely isolate instructional methods and conditions when describing research studies and thus impact real world classroom decisions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><span style="font-family: helvetica;" data-keep-original-tag="false" data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">Meta analyses are starting to illuminate this area. Akg√ºn and Atƒ±cƒ± (2022) observed that there was only a moderate effect on learner achievement after surveying 31 studies. Kaplan, Cruit, Endsley, Beers, Sawyer and Hancock found that ‚ÄúXR does not express a different outcome than training in a non-simulated, control environment. It is equally effective at enhancing performance‚Äù (2020, p. 1) Some researchers are starting to incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence into this challenge in order to determine what the published records states about immersive experiences. Markowitz et al. (2024) recently surveyed 196,734 paper abstracts with this method.</span></p>

<p data-original-attrs="{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}">I find this myth is misleading.

                <h1 style="text-align: left;">Dispelling Myths</h1>
<p>With some background established on boom and bust cycles in the hype for immersive experiences (Parts <a href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/10/from-myths-to-principles-navigating.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>, <a href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-immersive-environment-delusion-part.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2</a>, and <a href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/11/part-3-case-against-virtual-campuses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3</a>), we need to dismiss the rather rampant myths about learning within immersive experiences. In the hype, learning advantages have been overstated and over simplified. Web pages post outrageous claims (and I‚Äôll show you!). Keynote presentations banty incredible promises (yup, it was recorded). This series addresses the four primary myths about learning within immersive experiences: that is, that it is faster, greater, active, and induces empathy. <br><br>In this Part 4, I‚Äôll address the ‚Äúlearners learn faster in immersive experiences‚Äù myth. For those of you that follow my writing, you‚Äôll know that this is Round 3 of me taking on this myth. My argument has not changed; remember this article series is an update, but not every point needs updating. However, I continue to communicate about this because the ‚ÄúVR learning is faster‚Äù myth continues to circulate‚Äì mostly in the reference to ‚Äú4 times faster‚Äù and the PwC report. So, TLDR, the VR experience was designed to be 29 minutes long. That‚Äôs it. No longer. The classroom equivalent in content experience was designed to be 2 hours long. That‚Äôs it. 29 minutes is ¬º of 120 minutes. Someone inverted ¬º to 4x (which is factually true) and PwC who appears to have had a cozy contract with Oculus/Meta at the time, went out to trumpet the ‚Äòfour times‚Äô from the rooftops. But students do NOT learn faster. They experienced a learning event that was designed to be faster. Had the learners spent 120 minutes in the headset, someone would have probably greedily snatched the headset off their heads and told them that they overstayed their welcome (and wondered what they were doing for the extra 91 minutes).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Myth: Learners learn faster in immersive experiences</h2>
<p>The first myth asserts that learners learn faster with immersive experiences. Particularly, the phrase ‚Äúfour times faster‚Äù has taken root in the publications and in public discourse. A google search on the phrase ‚ÄúVR is 4 times faster‚Äù returns a plethora of results repeating the myth.</p>

And it's not hard to catch, yo.</figcaption></figure>
<p><br>The source of this phrase is suggested to be one non-peer reviewed industry report by PricewaterhouseCooper. Within the report, VR-based learning was ‚Äú4x faster than classroom training on average‚Äù (Eckert &amp; Mower, 2020, p. 8). The results of this report were then repeated in academic literature.</p>

<p>Referring to the same report, D. Clark (an educational researcher not known for getting data wrong, but he did) wrote enthusiastically that ‚ÄúVR was x4 faster than classroom and x1.5 faster than e-learning‚Äù (2021, p. 190). Claims that learning is completed faster attempt to represent immersive experiences as a more efficient learning method, i.e., less time to learn equals learning faster.</p>
<p><br>Tracking down how many academic papers have cited the PwC report is difficult. I've seen numbers as little as 4 citations and much higher numbers if I start flexing my search. Part of the problem is that folks have not cited the report (even though it calls itself a study) correctly. Some credit PwC, a few find the Eckert and Mower authors, but in general the hand wave approach to referring to the 4x data is very prevalent.</p>
<p><br><br>The cause of this supposed faster learning was attributed to how a VR headset isolates the learner‚Äôs perception, so that the learner is focused on the learning task at hand. In other words, less distraction equals more focus. In the PricewaterhouseCooper report, Likens seemed to hypothesize that, ‚ÄúA lot of courses that normally take an hour could be completed in 20 minutes through VR because people are so immersed in scenarios, there are fewer distractions and the learning is very concentrated‚Äù (Zielinski, 2021, para. 10). <br><br>To be clear, in the PwC case, classroom learning which covered the same content was designed to take two hours to complete. The immersive experience was designed to take 29 minutes. Given that 29 minutes is approximately one-quarter of two hours, PwC inverted the time ratio and touted the line that the immersive learning was four times faster. The problem is that it is not true that learning in the immersive experience was faster. The VR-based learning took less time because it was designed to be a 29-minute one-on-one learning experience designed for a shorter total time duration. When compared to classroom learning, it is already known that one-on-one personalized learning is generally faster; it moves at the speed of the learner, not at the speed of the class. Perhaps, this is how myths begin. A kernel of truth gets extended to something with no context. Lack of context is a noted and rising problem in educational research (Williamson, 2024).<br><br>Learning faster can be confused with greater efficiency. Efficiency could have a wide range of meanings beyond just taking less time. It could also mean wiser use of resources or less teaching burden on the instructor. Another example of the loose wordplay is on an industry webpage that displayed that VR training was 50% faster than a traditional in-person medical simulation. Not stated in the distilled summary of that study is that <em>learners scored worse in the VR training than the traditional</em> in-person medical simulation (Katz et al., 2020).</p>

<p><br><br>The myth that learning happens faster continues when educators fail to acknowledge that a different instructional method was being used. When supporting using virtual reality for chemistry studies, Muhsinah Morris, a chemistry professor and metaverse program director at Morehouse said ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt see molecules, but in my virtual reality classroom where I taught advanced inorganic chemistry, you can. You can actually build three-dimensional representations of molecules ‚Ä¶ The learning tends to happen faster. They go on to the real situation faster.‚Äù (D‚ÄôAgostino, 2022, para. 5).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Side point: Learning Chemistry in Three Dimensions</h2>
<p>Since this is my publishing space, I am going to spend some time on Mushinah Morris‚Äô instructional and learning point here. Again, I was involved in the online teaching of chemistry for 14 years and my research speciality was science in VR, so I‚Äôve got thoughts. If you would like to see her talk on video on this, she‚Äôs in <a href="https://youtu.be/F3bQ4Aw3Vis?si=JuJ4QvIQS9X5USCJ&amp;t=70" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this VictoryXR video</a>.<br><br>She is correct that molecules cannot currently be seen in everyday life. It makes chemistry, as a field, a more abstract or conceptual field (along with physics) when compared to the ‚Äúyou can see it before you‚Äù fields of biology or earth science. Teaching that something unseen exists and engages in reactions has always been the uphill battle of chemistry teachers. So she‚Äôs describing an accurate problem. <br><br>There is a tiny fly in the ointment, however, in that not many students at the college level fall into a chemistry course completely unfamiliar with chemistry at all. So learners in college chemistry probably were exposed to atoms in some other prior learning experience, be it high school, a museum, or a summer-camp like situation. So do her students need to learn atoms from the very beginning? I somewhat doubt that.¬†</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">HCHE Advanced Inorganic Chemistry</h3>
<p>To massively further complicate her argument, she names and shows her chemistry course ‚ÄúAdvanced Inorganic Chemistry‚Äù. That‚Äôs HCHE 421 at Morehouse University, which in 2021 had a prerequisite: <br><br>HCHE 322 Elementary Physical Chemistry,</p>
<p>which itself has 3 prerequisites: <br><br>CHE 321/321L, Elementary Physical Chemistry and Lab (which has 4 prereqs: CHE 232, PHY 154, and MTH 161 and 162)<br><br>PHY 253 Electricity &amp; Magnetism, which has 2 prerequisites: PHY 154 (C or better) and MTH 162<br><br>MTH 271 Introduction to Linear Algebra, which has 1 prerequisite: MTH 161 <br><br>You see where I‚Äôm going here.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs highly doubtful that students arriving in an advanced chemistry class after what is <i>years at college</i>, whose content focus is actually math (that‚Äôs what inorganic focuses on) and not spatial abilities (which arguably organic chemistry DOES focus on) have a substantial problem with visualizing atoms and molecules to the point where it is disturbing their learning performance. And therefore VR could make a difference. No. Not buying it.¬†</p>

<p><br>Nonetheless, I‚Äôve known very smart people have trouble visualizing atoms. So it IS remotely possible and let‚Äôs pretend she is articulating only the beginning of the trouble of understanding for a lay crowd‚Ä¶not the only problem. Said another way, she's speaking about VR's affordances overall, maybe not specifically for her students in her aforementioned class. For example, some chemical reactions are easy to understand (like cooking) and some are difficult to understand (like how hair coloring works or cell electrical potentials).<br><br>It is interesting that she said ‚ÄúThe learning tends to happen faster.‚Äù It‚Äôs a couched statement, for sure, with the word ‚Äútends‚Äù. In science that cannot be pinned down. So she gave herself an out. But what was she describing? At this point, we have to think about the instruction of chemistry.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">How To Show Atoms and Molecules</h3>
<p>Within the history of chemistry itself is the continuing saga of how will atoms be depicted? As in, how do you draw them? How are they really? And how does a teacher relay that ‚Äòrealness‚Äô to the learners‚Äì and why?¬†</p>
<p>So we‚Äôve had our:</p>
<p>Atoms are indivisible tiny units, folks. <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Chemistry_for_Changing_Times_(Hill_and_McCreary)/02%3A_Atoms/2.01%3A_Atoms_-_Ideas_from_the_Ancient_Greeks">Thank you to the Greeks</a>! There are no pictures from that time.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve had Bohr‚Äôs heliocentric-like model folks wherein the atom looks like a solar system or set of concentric rings. To be fair, the heliocentric model really does help explain things like electron energy levels.</p>
<p>¬†</p>

<p><br>We‚Äôve had our Thomson plum pudding folks‚Äì which never translated from its culture. Which is probably a shame. I like plums.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVgn22KNTjuudLWm0L9MzuJ2O26K_9SY8GYDN4PSoeIUlztvF0e8jD3sUXDpcvqYQuJpel4RGOULljzOIaJUBE28xAdP37IVYbppmCrOC5ZmHL8xw7y9-dVRnZRHnos049QjKMsUOxHuSe8Rr1opzXbOJyq4mwbY7eFrLOoROqUAvX3GZt66KMrIU5mz4/w320-h117/plum%20pudding%20model.png" border="0" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Thompson's plum pudding atomic model.</figcaption></figure>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>We‚Äôve had our ‚Äòcloud model‚Äô folks - which are like the postmodern philosophers of chemistry. Truth for me, truth for you, we all get a truth. Which isn‚Äôt <em>actually</em> true. But they told us that electrons cannot be pinned down and measured, they could be anywhere at any time but when we set about measuring them, that‚Äôs when they run away from us. Yes, I‚Äôm nodding to Heisenberg here. And wave/particle theory.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibpJhvPiUq6dUB_5YtuQDvewBFwmWmaatUZaeCm_LDXSJ_9RcU3HZQ_19lsf70Yt8fO3wV00L0I7h7qcjsLcv3OGEp3WBeZBiUBDa-Pgyq7QVJZ3ccIS_czFNctafILtLeceAvTO2smQ3tsxJoMJAO8EaXdjiHR3s7Lq6ITOXF3eRsw02pa0lMiyV6Boo/w320-h133/Screenshot%202024-11-11%20095220.png" alt="Cloud model of what an atom looks like." width="320" height="133" border="0" data-original-height="285" data-original-width="685" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Cloud model of what an atom looks like.</figcaption></figure>
<p>After the heliocentric model, however, depictions of atoms needed to be displayed as three-dimensional, not just as two-dimensional on flat paper. By far, I‚Äôve only selected some of the atomic model theories here. If you want to know more, study chemistry! It‚Äôs not hard.<br><br>But, now, going against Mushinah Morris‚Äô arguments now, educators HAVE been working on that educational problem for years (with success, mind you).</p>
<p>First of all, delightful molecular (and atom) kits exist with physical manipulatives. Yeah, they look like tinker toys.¬† I love them. They are good for at least 30 minutes of instruction, maybe more. They are usually plastic (boo, although there is nothing stopping them from being made of wood) and the kits would have to be purchased, stored, and de-germed from time to time. So they have their minor downsides.</p>
<p>Second of all, 2D screens can show 3D objects‚Ä¶that‚Äôs entirely possible.</p>
<p>Third, programming VR to follow mathematical principles ‚Äì like, voila, chemistry DOES!-- is actually not that hard. The first uses of VR in education that I know of were in the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù---that is mathematical sciences, physics and chemistry. Let‚Äôs face it. A computer understands 9.8 meters per second per second MUCH easier than a person does. (&lt;- that‚Äôs one gravitational force).<br><br><br>And get this, purchasing a simulation to teach atoms is so drop-dead cheap that it‚Äôs actually <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">free </a>by now. I have recommended those simulations for courses before and seen learning scores do quite well, thank you.¬†</p>

<p><br>I seriously bet that if I had been able to place that counter proposal before her administrators, I‚Äôd win the budget proposal. Ha! Bonus points that I could prove that my students would score equal to her VR students on the final exam.<br><br>So in all, did she make a good point here? I‚Äôd say no but that‚Äôs because I recognize the instructional problem and I realize that the problem can be solved in a much cheaper and equally as efficient way. Also, she showed no data that ‚Äúthe learners learned faster‚Äù.<br><br>Side point to the side point: Mushinah Morris on YouTube is highly associated with VictoryXR, the vendor that she is using when referring to her VR-for-education accomplishments. Close association with XR vendors makes for suspicious conclusions. I'm not picking on Mushinah Morris unfairly. She's gone on the record multiple times for her claims. I could easily pick (and will in the future) other education influencers that are selling the VR-for-education snake oil.<br><br>Back to my article<br><br><br>Further, there is at least one study (so far!) that refutes this focusing-causes-faster-learning claim. Makransky, Terkildsen, et al. (2019) found that immersive metaverse environments could be sensory overload for learners and therefore decrease the learner‚Äôs focus. On the whole, claims for increased speed can often be attributed to more efficient instructional methods. Immersive experiences can allow for the utilization of comparatively faster instructional methods.<br><br>The author finds this myth, that immersive experiences cause learners to learn faster, false.¬†</p>

                <p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">I write this title with a tinge of irony. I‚Äôve owned virtual campuses. I‚Äôve worked on virtual campuses. If asked to work on a virtual campus again, I‚Äôd likely say yes.¬† So what‚Äôs my beef with virtual campuses? </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">I feel that a sober-eyed look at virtual campuses* is necessary.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Following the philosophy of ‚Äúthose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it‚Äù (Santayana), here is Part 3 of my series: From Myths to Principles; Navigating Instructional Design in Immersive Environments.</span></p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The rise and fall of the metaversity</span></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">In <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://heatheredodds.blogspot.com/2024/10/the-immersive-environment-delusion-part.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 2</a> of this series,I examined two examples from the history of immersive learning. First, I showed the parallels when companies like Meta and Linden Lab dominate a single platform for immersive learning designs. The lesson is that what is allowed one day can quickly become disallowed the next day. Second, I pointed out the inappropriate boasting and poor course design used in the ‚Äúfirst course in virtual reality‚Äù by Stanford University. In these recent cases (Meta and Stanford University) there was a remarkable lack of awareness of the history of immersive learning. Said another way, mistakes of the past were repeated.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">In another example of history repeating itself, ten colleges and universities adopted digital twin campuses in June 2022 using the ENGAGE platform with monetary support and donated VR headsets from Meta (Koenig, 2022). These metaversity locations recreated (or <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://sway.cloud.microsoft/RyZEZBkthFHDhku7?ref=Link" rel="noopener noreferrer">created</a>!) campus buildings to allow learners to gather on the virtual campus.¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eight years prior, Second Life (SL) campus buildings were ‚Äúdesigned to mimic real-world architectural equivalents‚Äù but had become ‚Äúabandoned ghost towns‚Äù (Wecker, 2014).¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">The early Second Life virtual campus creations were often the result of student projects. Confusingly, the professors who designed and assigned these projects touted the work of creating faithful campus recreations as <i>creative</i> and thus, at the highest level of Bloom‚Äôs cognitive learning objectives. I‚Äôm inserting a heavy eye roll here because that‚Äôs really stretching the justification of working in virtual reality to an extreme point.¬† Plus, I have to point out: what does next year‚Äôs class build if this year‚Äôs class made the campus?¬† My point is that simply building campus buildings (so that you can have a virtual campus!) is a project idea that runs out of steam. Things got really interesting right after the SL virtual campuses were launched.¬† Everyone involved noticed that the spaces were not being utilized.¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">¬†</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Students were asked why they weren't visiting the virtual campus.¬† </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">The answer was simple.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">No one was there. </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">You see, you could have the most amazing design with all of the bells and whistles (really!), but if people were not there, then people found that there was no compelling reason to return. Admissions folks had no compelling reason to be in the virtual admissions building, same for financial aid teams. Even library teams today in virtual reality struggle to staff spaces with the same spread as IRL (in real life) libraries.</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">During a recent tour of the University of Maryland Global Campus metaversity campus, the audio connection failed. The host did not offer any tech support. The experience showcased empty buildings during what was a busy time of the academic semester. To be fair, I understand the implications of FERPA which might have predicted that students were in classroom spaces separate from public spaces. However, it is logical that on any campus, students could still be found¬† in public space buildings like the networking lounge. These accurate campus recreations rarely spur more than a passing interest to learners.¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph is-empty" aria-label="Write here. You can also include @mentions."><span style="font-family: arial;">¬†</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">The ten colleges and universities in this project are now facing the end of the project and the initial funding is ending. Steven Van Hook commented that, ‚ÄúAdministrators may speak of their twin campuses in glittering terms on the record ‚Äìthen off the record talk about their regrets and what else they could have bought for the hundreds of thousands of dollars‚Äù (VWBPE, 2024). According to Temple University‚Äôs Kathy Hirsh Pasek, ‚ÄúA year ago, a lot of companies were going full steam ahead. Today‚Äôs that‚Äôs not true; they‚Äôve rerouted a lot of their funds for AI and Twitter alternatives‚Äù (Coffey, 2023, para. 37) Institutions made the decision to adopt immersive experiences but do not appear to know how to make wise decisions when generous funding stops and societal attention moves on.</span></p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The key problems</span></h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, throughout these first three parts of this series, there are several challenges apparent. Instructional designers and administrators must wade through the myriad of claims derived from dubious research studies. It feels like chicanery to figure out which statements about immersive experiences for learning are authentic and do point the way to future positive outcomes and which statements are in doubt. The first issue is with interpreting research wisely. Every research study has inherent flaws; no one study can definitively provide answers to all of education‚Äôs questions. This situation is made worse when the research is translated into social media and seems to tout incredible claims (Lanier et al., 2019).</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, the conundrum has been illuminated. The myths that appear to come from a research basis must be dispelled. Next, the very basis of the published research record is at risk of bias and problems. This series will inform on what characteristics to look for in published research.¬† Finally, if one were to step around the research interpretation problems, what is the system for building and using immersive experiences for its best advantage? This series will attempt to answer these questions. This series then forms the navigator role for instructional designers and administrators figuring out how to chart a route to a successful implementation. </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__heading"><span style="font-family: arial;">Post Script</span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">*virtual campuses </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">I‚Äôm using the term virtual campuses to specifically refer to real world recreations of campus spaces like quads and lecture halls. I am not referring to simulations (for example in science courses) or spaces specifically designed for social use (for example, dance halls). </span></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><span style="font-family: arial;">Virtual campuses were designed as early as 1999 as text-based educational MUVEs (multi user virtual environments). This example classroom shows ‚Äúthe room‚Äôs description, list of contents, who¬† is in the room, the exits, and links to applications‚Äù (Maher, et al., 1999).</span></p>

<div id="docs-internal-guid-195a7ea9-7fff-f06d-26c5-8b3e4fa397e0" style="line-height: 1.56; margin-bottom: 2pt; margin-top: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The history of educational technology is a rhyme that repeats. Initial pitches have created optimism that the next big thing in technology will revolutionize education. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/07/the-computer-delusion/376899/">Oppenheimer</a> (1997) in a really well written article illustrated part of the history of educational technology by citing four examples:</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Edison‚Äôs 1922 prediction that the motion picture will revolutionize education.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Levenson‚Äôs claim that radios will become common in every classroom.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Skinner asserted that learners with teaching machines could learn twice as much.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Clinton campaigned that computers are a bridge to the twenty-first century. (para. 1)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The motion picture, the radio receiver, programmed instruction, and computers in the classroom have all failed to significantly impact learner performance. The past 102 years have not been kind to hyped educational technology predictions.</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align: left;">I can hear you through the nether. <br>There are some saying "But the metaverse is different!" <br>Sit down. üëàüò†<br>I'll deal with you soon enough.</div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>Cuban (1986) further suggested that this educational technology adoption cycle follows a predictable pattern. First, the earliest research will be produced by the technology producers themselves. Second, problems arise with adoption. Learner performance does not improve over the long term. The final stage in the cycle is blame-finding with reasons ranging from not enough money, educator resistance, and educational systems resistant to change. The methods and reasoning for incorporating the technology are rarely addressed in the historical or market record. The reader of this series might recognize these statements already being made about immersive experiences. As such, hype cycles for immersive experiences are already underway.<br>¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This last point deserves emphasis. Here are the steps again:</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>1. Tech producers make the first "research".<br>2. Tech adopted, but learner performance does not improve long term.<br>3. Blame-finding ensues.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>I wanted to emphasize these points because they are going to appear in the research record that I will present. </span></div>
<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-195a7ea9-7fff-f06d-26c5-8b3e4fa397e0" style="line-height: 1.56; margin-bottom: 2pt; margin-top: 12pt; text-align: left;"></h1>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Immersive experiences have already weathered several boom and bust cycles. One cycle began between 2003 and 2009. The desktop-based virtual reality program called Second Life, created by Linden Lab, attracted over 100 universities (Brown &amp; Sugar, 2009) and thousands of dollars of investment (Wecker, 2014).<br><br>In a sudden decision, Linden Lab eliminated its 50% discount for educational institutions (Harrison, 2010). What resulted was an educator exodus and fracture in the faith of immersive experiences for education. When referring to the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/woodbury-u-banned-from-second-life-again">shutdown of Woodbury University‚Äôs virtual campus</a> for breach of conduct, Jordan Bellino, a senior learner at the institution, described the hazard when one major company dominates use:<br><br>The incident suggests the dangers of online meeting spaces‚Äô being run by companies, which get to decide who participates and who doesn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúIt took years and thousands of dollars to make that virtual campus happen,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand it all vanished in a matter of an hour because Linden Lab pushed a button.‚Äù (Young, 2010, para. 12)<br><br>Major technology companies can single-handedly dictate use of immersive environments. This would be a valuable lesson lost before the next boom cycle began in 2018.</span></p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>After the launch of the consumer-oriented Quest headsets and the mandate for remote learning due to the COVID pandemic in 2020, interest in immersive environments surged. In June of 2021, Stanford opened their Virtual People course to 263 learners (Bailenson, 2021).¬†</span></div>

</a></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">¬†</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">The course was touted to be the first class in the world to be held inside of virtual reality (Hadhazy, 2021) which seemed to cast aside the nearly two-decade deep body of research on courses held as immersive experiences. The prestige of the course was further hyped when one of the course professors boasted:</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">I can now stand up in front of all my students and there's, you know, two hundred in the class, and I can say you will actually have a better chance of getting a job in the Valley because of taking this class because as of about a year ago, the most sought-after job in the Valley went from a data scientist to a VR engineer. (<a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/education/stanford-virtual-reality-class-puts-students-in-metaverse">Bellini,</a> 2024, para 12)</span></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>The VR-based learning resulted in greater presence, enjoyment, motivation, and transfer (Han &amp; Bailenson, 2024). However, within the course, all was not well. Video clips from the class showed learners struggling to control their avatars (Bailenson, 2021) and attending class just to stand around in circles (Bellini, 2021).</span></div>
<div>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gOLI_OIV3nc?si=jv2LF-d4Dz8sIZsf" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>In spite of the boasting, published reports illuminated problems with onboarding learners to the VR headset experience, unexpected software updates, and sudden platform shutdowns (Han &amp; Bailenson, 2024).¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>The instructional design was described as <strong><i>learning by doing</i></strong>, but the syllabus showed a majority of outside-of-virtual-world writing and quiz items. Within the immersive environment, there were required weekly discussion sessions (Han et al., 2022) and one project where learners could import 3D (three-dimensional) objects to make a unique VR environment. My translation? That's not much doing, actually, as it relates to being a "virtual person".¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Much to the professors‚Äô astonishment, one group of learners made a mock fake moon landing production set (Brown et al., 2023). For the course instructors, this suddenly raised the specter that immersive experiences can create false depictions or fake memories, a topic that will be revisited in the ethical labyrinths section of this series.</span></div>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">In Part 3, I'll share another example of boom and bust from the immersive environments-for-education market.<br><br></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Post-publication edit:</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>They say there is no editor like the "Publish" button and that makes me laugh because you DO spot errors after something has been published.¬† But in this case, it's not an error that I want to address, I want to add more depth and context to this post. Since it's my blog, I can. This work was previously planned to be a book chapter and as such, I held my tongue on some of my more pointed criticism and images. But here, I can lay out things more directly.<br></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Directly I am pointing to the </span>Communication 166/266:<span style="font-family: helvetica;">Virtual People course as a poor design from an instructional designer's point of view. I have studied the syllabus and read several articles and watched videos produced about the course.¬† You can read <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/downloads/comm166" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the syllabus yourself!</a></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>What I can't find is how many credits the course was. Just guessing from the workload in the syllabus, I'd guess 2 credits.¬† Could be 3 but it also could be 1. I severely doubt it's 4. <br><br>Where do I get the platform to critique this course?<br><br>1. I have 14 years full time experience teaching online. Until ~2034, there are very few that can match me with that kind of full time online teaching experience. Bailenson's class was arguably not "online" by definition (it happened in June 2021 or so and that would be post-shutdown), but it appears to have happened entirely remotely with the exception of picking up the headsets. So I can claim some expertise about what SHOULD happen with digital-based, if not online, instruction.<br>2. My doctorate is in Instructional Design specifically *for Online Learning*. So I've spent my time focusing on that.<br>3. My research focus was and is learning in immersive environments (hence this article series).<br>4. Uniquely, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-taught-one-earths-first-courses-oculus-quest-2-heather-dodds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I ALSO taught a course using the Meta Quest 2s</a> which had a similar "survey" type of design. So what Bailenson did by visiting topics each week briefly is NOT part of my critique.<br><br>Three things are my main concerns here:</span></p>
<h4 style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br><strong>1. Video clips show a ridiculous amount of on-boarding malarkey.¬†</strong> </span></h4>
<p style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Said another way, bringing learners into a 3D environment, not acclimating them to this and then bringing in various models and just letting the users play is nice for an introduction. It does NOT make a course and certainly it does not argue for a widespread use of the technology.<br><br>I'm sure that in one version of the video, I could hear learners over and over again gathered in small groups supposedly "doing" something in VR only to hear "can anyone hear me?" as a COMMON statement. Take my word for it; a class filled <i>from beginning to end</i> with learners not being able to hear or be heard does not count for much learning.<br></span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">My point: there isn't evidence that anything other than some "visits" to VR happened.¬† And yet, over and over, this flagship course (my phrase) has learners that can't walk, can't wave, cannot follow instructions and (I guess) can't hear instructions. After week one, the learners *should* be on-boarded, all practiced up and ready to do harder things. 'Just walk over here for a group photo' should not feel like a nearly impossible task-- but the videos sure do make it look like it was.¬† <br><br>I had to giggle üòÑ because in that "all class" photo, there is one avatar in 2D, not in a headset, because they don't have hands and their movement is all 2D-type, and they are the only one that looks "logical" in their behaviors.<br><br>2.<strong> Bailenson really shows his excitement¬† </strong></span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">(in the somewhat unprofessional video) <strong>but also the "un-put-togetherness" of this experience </strong>with the his statement: <br><br></span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">I can now stand up in front of all my students and there's, you know, two hundred in the class, and I can say you will actually have a better chance of getting a job in the Valley because of taking this class because as of about a year ago, the most sought-after job in the Valley went from a data scientist to a VR engineer.

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>I find it VERY hard to believe that this one course at the 100 and 200 level will lead to 200 new VR engineer's getting jobs in "the Valley".¬† Insert hard eyeroll here. üôÑ¬† It looks extra bravado-y when he phrases it as "I can now stand up" as if he's really planning to do this or HAS done it.¬† It's a brag.¬† No humble about it.¬† Last I checked, the Valley wants to hire computer scientists, who should be in calculus class at the same time as this headset romp. Fact check: The Valley has been laying off VR teams.¬† So how's that 'better chance of getting a job' brag going for ya?<br><br>3. <strong>The learn-by-doing quote gets under my skin </strong>as an instructional designer. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Learn WHAT by doing WHAT, in this case? His students had to use pre-existing 3D models included in the ENGAGE platform (OK, fine-- but note that I didn't see ANY examples of models beyond ones we've already seen in ENGAGE advertising) to build a scene that was basically their final project.¬†</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">(Again, disclosure: my students final project was a video mock-up of an immersive experience that they would design, if they could. The course taught no programming skills.)¬†</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">So OK, it's fine that learners can't program after 1 course. Totally understood. But then the learners put together a final project scene that sounds like Bailenson's team spit out their coffee over...J. Brown source described the team experience as, "jarring" and wanted to coin a new phrase, "mis-experience."¬† What the phrase? Garbage in, garbage out?¬† You don't design a compelling course and the results surprise you?¬† Sigh.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.44; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">It appears that they took the "made lemonade from lemons" approach. Note that I haven't mentioned ANYTHING about comparative learning outcomes related to this heralded course. Because there isn't any data on that. Not like there should be, but the research is remarkably silent ü§´ on that. <br><br>Also fact check on this: the Meta Quest 2 headsets are officially OUT of support and sale from Meta. So they are, as of this writing, outdated. I wonder how it's going over there at Stanford. Do they just ring up Mark and ask for 266 more headsets in the Meta Quest 3 type now?<br><br>I haven't mentioned, (actually I left it OUT), how much ENGAGE got free advertising from this mess. That's because they are really the main characters in the NEXT episode.<br><br></span></p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This article begins a new series where I intend to continue to bust myths related to learning in immersive environments while also advocating for research-based decisions related to instructional design.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>Now if that sounded like gobbly-gook, this might not be the series for you. But, for anyone with an interest in virtual worlds, the metaverse, or even a simple 2D simulation and the uses of these for education, this is the RIGHT place for you. <br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">¬†</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">This is an updated version of my original 8-part Instructional Design in the Metaverse series. (Did you miss that? Here's my <a href="https://youtu.be/Rr4dzKLPlpQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 minute explainer video</a>.) I estimate that I have at least 15 parts right now to start this series and new research comes in every day. However, t</span><span style="font-family: helvetica;">his being my blog, I intend to spill a little more tea here than I do in other places.</span><br><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>Buckle up buttercups</span>!<hr></div>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><br>A wondrous thing happens the first time a learner steps into the metaverse; the learner enters a land of digital imagination. The immersive technology creates and presents what the learner senses visually and auditorily. Because those experiences are digital creations, the possibilities can be as varied and broad as human imagination. This wide open promise of anything anywhere has attracted educators and researchers for more than two decades. Within the body of research generated from this attraction, significant challenges remain for those interested in the prudent application of the immersive learning design.<br><br>The global virtual reality (VR) industry is forecast to reach $435 billion in United States dollars within the next 6 years, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 27% (Yahoo Finance, 2023). Immersive or extended reality (XR) technologies are broad combinations of computer technology that overlays or fully surround the learner with digitally constructed sights, sounds, smell, taste, pressure, heat, and texture sensations (Ziker et al., 2021). XR as a broad term is understood to encompass virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). Immersive experiences stand distinct as an educational media choice due to the factors of immersion, embodiment, and presence that arise within the learner (Southgate, 2020). This series will use the term immersive experiences to refer to the inclusive concept of learning within virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, cross reality, transmedia, and the metaverse. <br><br>Immersive experiences are expected to expand within the next few years in the areas of education, industrial training, and healthcare where the influence of instructional design could be beneficial. Educators have already been turning to immersive experiences for uses such as simulation, training, providing access to limited resources and to bridge distances as a form of remote learning (Kavanaugh et al., 2017). New educators and designers, however, often express a sense of being overwhelmed at the idea of designing instruction that would essentially be spherical (as in, surrounding the learner) and containing infinite potential (immersive experiences could contain any information or process). Unquestioningly, everyone feels that the design work is complex. <br><br>Regardless, there are still educators who, despite sudden platform shutdowns and expensive contracts, feel that immersive experiences have 'enormous unrealized potential‚Äô (Wecker, 2014). The complexity of designing for the metaverse calls for assistance from instructional design that focuses on ‚Äúinstructional methods, specific features that facilitate actual learning‚Äù (Honebein &amp; Reigeluth, 2023. p. 292). Unfortunately, heretofore immersive experiences have precipitated haphazard designs lacking guidance:<br><br></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Education researchers borrow heavily from the entertainment designers, who focus on engagement, and not necessarily on retention of content. The dearth of studies highlights the urgency for a set of guidelines for designing content that allows users to make appropriate choices in a spherical space. (Johnson-Glenberg, 2018, p. 7)</span></p>

</a></div>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Therefore, this series will begin with looking at the current state of immersive experiences for learning research. Published research however, often falls short of the mark. This series will contribute to both fundamental and practical applications (Shi &amp; Evans, 2023), landing in Pasteur‚Äôs Quadrant as Mayer (2020) suggested, as ‚Äúbasic research in applied situations‚Äù (p. 22). This series draws from the body of published research in the form of a selective consumer; it discriminates seeking to understand the wise applications of immersive environments. Additionally, it addresses real problems faced by instructional designers and administrators. Staying grounded in reality will be very important as we journey into the research of virtual worlds.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">We will begin with some history, next post.</span></p>

<p><br><br>I purchased "VisiSolar Solar Eclipse Glasses Made in USA Pack of 1 CE ISO Certified NASA..." from Walmart.com for $7.99 on March 11, 2024.¬† Later on the day of my online order, Heuvelton Free Library announced that they were giving away eclipse glasses for free. üòñ Bummer.¬† Actually, I don't have a final positive opinion about these flimsy glasses. I found the view to be less detailed than what I saw through welder's glass.¬† However, they WERE a bit easier to finagle over my smartphone camera lens for a photo.</p>
<p>Test photo the day before the eclipse:</p>

It's already interesting that some of my observations match up. The times look a little off, but I couldn't get more exact on the location with Time and Date.</p>
<p>These predicted details were correct in that the moon moved from the lower right to the upper left in apparent view across the sun at my location. (Some video shots from astronomical equipment reverse up and down).</p>

<p>Fortunately, St. Lawrence County Chamber of Commerce put out a detailed timing list and I was able to note it for my location. This was VERY helpful and I scribbled it on a post-it that I kept in my pocket to remind me of official start and end times.</p>

<p>I had also heard that welder's glass or a welder's helmet would be OK for viewing the eclipse. As a blessing, Dad and more likely, my Grandpa left a welder's mask in my barn workshop that I dusted off and tested beforehand. I thought that worked out very well, although taking photos was a struggle to get it the camera inside the face mask.¬† <br><br>One more prep that I did was to decide to do the <a href="https://observer.globe.gov/about/get-the-app" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NASA Globe Observer app</a> eclipse temperature observations. So I purchased a special digital wired thermometer for that (it's in the photos) but I found it to be a constant nuisance because the readings were different from each other (inside and outside) and that should not be happening when the entire unit is in the same air -- outside! Grr.¬† I thought the readings were consistently 0.4 degrees off, but that was not true as they did fluctuate. I brought out 3 more thermometers just to guess who was reading what temperature correctly. We were advised in the Globe Observer eclipse training to NOT depend or use a weather app for the temperature. I would verify that that was good advice as the weather app didn't update, I think, anywhere near as dynamically as the temperature did change. At some points, I had more than 1 degree air temperature change inside of 5 minutes.<br><br>The Globe Observer app also collects cloud observations, mosquito habitat mapping, land cover, and tree observations. I took several cloud observations during the event. NASA should email me later to let me know if they can calibrate my "ground truthing" photos of the clouds with a GOES Satellite overhead. I also took one land cover measurement to show my thermometer, as per the eclipse suggested protocol.</p>

<p>I chose to stick with the Globe Observer app and temperature readings because I could do those even if we had cloud cover.¬† I was tempted to try the <a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/nasa-smartphone-eclipse-app/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SunSketcher app</a> which was designed to try and capture Baily's Bead photos.

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Partial Eclipse</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">¬†</h2>
<p>After a hurried lunch, I set up my camping chair, telescope (hopeful that I could see the comet during the eclipse), binoculars (I am experienced at how to safely use binoculars during a solar event), water, notebook, pen, thermometers, and nervous chocolate (no shame). I realized at that point that the Globe Observer wanted one to start 2 hours before. It had actually jingled my phone and I ignored it. Oops. So I was a little late on that start time.</p>

<p>2:53 ~50% of sun covered. Last temperature reading switched from "outside" to "inside" as it calibrates to 2 other thermometers. (The outside temperature only matched 1 other thermometer.)</p>

<p>3:17 Feels darker - like wrong weird dark.<br><br>3:20 Clicking sound from the ground- like a temp drop. Mosquitos eating. Darker, heavy clouds but still can see a shadow.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Totality</h2>
<p>The darkness approached fast. I took photos as what looked like a sudden storm bank.</p>
<p>3:23 I grabbed my camera as the darkness approached. I could hear my neighbors who were at most 4 houses west starting to whoop and holler. I had time to get these 7 next photos almost in serial fashion in one minute.</p>
<p>Something's coming.</p>

<p>I don't know why the photos improve but it probably was a combo of me slowing down and the street light shining more brightly (as it warms up).</p>

<p>One robin kept singing the whole time. <br>Could see the horizon of light around us.¬†</p>
<p>Temp dipped ~10 degrees in total (Fact check: It was 12.1 degrees total).¬† It read the 40s on one thermometer on the ground.<br><br>Neighbors were whopping it up, I took photos, the sun looked lovely as a ring in clouds!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Partial Eclipse Again</h2>
<p>Right after, Blue Jays calling a lot. Also could hear: mourning doves, robins, starlings, dogs barking.¬†</p>
<p>3:32 light feels back to normal, can see shadow, sliver of sun back</p>
<p>3:37 same light cracking sound from surface of the ground, not deep. No observed problems with birds.</p>
<p>3:38 Merlin flying again, seemed to call to its mate.</p>
<p>3:42 Still enough sun to see a shadow. Mosquitoes are bad-- hovering! Have to move away.</p>
<p>3:49 50% of light of sun showing now. Lots of things already back to normal. Temp is rising significantly now.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">Cheap glasses did not go through the clouds as well as the welder's glass or more truthfully, the cheap glasses blocked more.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">Didn't move thermometer. Wore long underwear -- glad I did if only against the mosquitos.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;">I didn't expect that "feeling the shadow" would feel so small-- you could see out of it to the horizon nearly the entire time.</p>
<p>3:55 60% of the sun back.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Thoughts</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span class="x193iq5w xeuugli x13faqbe x1vvkbs x1xmvt09 x1lliihq x1s928wv xhkezso x1gmr53x x1cpjm7i x1fgarty x1943h6x xudqn12 x3x7a5m x6prxxf xvq8zen xo1l8bm xzsf02u" dir="auto"> <span style="font-weight: normal;">I'll note one strange observation. I did hear a cracking or crackling sound lasting 2-3 seconds coming from the ground BEFORE (3:20pm ) and AFTER (3:37pm) the eclipse. Totality was timed for 3:25 for my location (but we were in diamond ring at 3:24).¬† So ~5 minutes before and ~12 minutes after peak totality this sound happened. The list from Time and Dates predicts that "animals and nature affected by falling levels of light". It was very faint and it sounded like the cracking sound a metal roof makes when heating up or cooling down. But the sound was coming from dry leaves on the ground, not from under the ground. It last long enough that I could turn my head around and hear it distinctly. I could not determine if it was just the decrease in light causing the leaves to cool and crackle (which is what I thought at the time) or if the slightest of breezes skirted the ground.</span></span></div>
<p><span class="break-words"><span dir="ltr">I was ever so thankful that my neighbor and his kids were outside in their yard through the event because I was nervous. Not "the apocalypse is going to happen" type of nervous. Don't be ridiculous! I am a follower of Jesus so apocalypses are not outside of my understanding but God works in a much more sneak attack manner than a predictable eclipse. My type of nervousness was more like "how dark is it going to get? Deep dark? Plunge into never-ness dark?" I could not picture how we get from cloudy to dark. <br><br>In the end, it swept over--just like those plague scenes from Exodus movies.<br><br>Right as totality started and we "winked" into deep twilight (that's how dark it was), my neighbor shouted "We survived!" with laughter. At that moment, I thought of all of the folks hiding underground in the first days of the Ukraine war, or of family members staying close to each other in Gaza and I thought "Yeah, we humans, we survive. We survive because we stick together." I've often wondered that if I was one of those people stuck in those situations, if I'd have the guts to sing. I think I'd want to sing. Just to be defiant and to show hope. Just to show, even if it was with my last breath, that evil doesn't have me. It was very emotional for me. I didn't come down off the adrenaline until about 7 p.m. last evening.<br><br>However, to keep myself calm and focused (and admittedly, I probably looked like a proper dork ü§ì walking around with a notebook and pen), I did citizen science all through the event with our 90% but translucent cloud cover, with the NASA Globe Observer app, taking temperature readings (there was a 12.1 degree Fahrenheit drop, see below) and observing changes in nature (birds, insects, light, wind, etc.).<br><br>While no animals (besides humans üòú ) behaved strangely DURING the eclipse, one robin sung all the way through (my spirit animal?) and it's wasn't a wrong or forelorn song. It was just his song-- like what he would sing at daybreak. After the eclipse, several birds, robins, mourning doves, starlings, blue jays, and the local merlins, seemed to do a repeat "morning cacophony" like they were re-finding each other.</span></span></p>

<p>Seeing the comet was a bust but I'll say I would NOT have had enough time even if I had my wits about me. I haven't seen the comet and getting the telescope onto something takes 5 minutes in the best of times.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">In sum</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In conclusion, I reached first for the words glorious, biblical, and scary/creepy.¬† I can understand how this event would have frightened people not knowing what it was because you didn't get the feeling that something weird was happening until just 3-5 minutes before totality started.<br><br>The eclipse did have a feeling to it. It's not pure science. It shook me. I spent some time contemplating these Bible verses:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Clouds and darkness</strong> surround him; he rules with righteousness and justice.¬† Psalm 92:7He tore the sky open and came down, with <strong>a dark cloud</strong> under his feet. 2 Samuel 22:10</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">He tore the sky open and came down with <strong>a dark cloud</strong> under his feet.¬† Psalm 18:9</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">But the people continued to stand a long way off, and only Moses went near <strong>the dark cloud </strong>where God was. Exodus 20:21</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been re-watching scenes from Gods and Kings by Christopher Nolan and I find that I'm liking that movie more each time -- despite others' objections (and my own).¬† A good old fashioned epic, sweeping "you are about to get spanked, bad guy" movie hits the spot sometimes. The speed of this eclipse which was the speed of earth?, the moon? was breathtaking. It just reminds you how quickly something can happen. And this was just the dance of the sun and moon.¬† There are bigger things in the universe.</p>
<p>It reminded me that God's power supreme, awesome, and not to be messed with. These two celestial bodies, the sun and moon, obey HIS rules.¬† That's entirely why this prediction of when a total eclipse of the sun would happen...worked. üòè</p>

<p>We should officially start our BTS story with the fact that this writing is a rejected academic book chapter.</p>
<p>üò¢</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Rejected Book Chapter</h2>
<p>Yeah. No shame, however, tossed towards the editors.¬† Their decision gets to be their decision.</p>
<p>I was unnerved that the editors were entirely China-based. I'm not saying one way or the other on that. Just that I'm aware that when political winds change, something that seemed like an OK idea at one point could become a very bad idea later.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a strange call for chapters in the first place, putting ALL of the approval at the END of the writing process. I went through a review and a rewrite only to be informed after 8 months that my writing didn't seem to fit what the editors were looking for.</p>
<p>The only tip I'll give about WHICH book it was was that I wrote a long section on myths and that aligned with the book's title.¬†</p>
<p>But...in the spirit of how the President of Stanford was brought down by what was originally a blog...I figured I'd go for it with self-publishing. Charging for a book? Right now, definitely not my style. Plus, I didn't want to wait another 8 months for another academic publication process. I told some of my ID friends that I would "juice it up" for LinkedIn and I did! The original chapter had NO images (strict publisher) and I whooped it up on LinkedIn with all kinds of visual "borrows" to help laymen deal with the academic language.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Key Points</h2>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li style="text-align: left;">Continuing to bang my drum on the 3 characteristics that make XR builds successful: <strong>reducing time, money, and/or danger.</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>focus on plot </strong>as the driving theme of an educational XR experience.</li>
<li>A focus on <strong>purpose</strong> at every step in the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>And these 3 items are not new for me to say. I've been trying to get them into the academy since 2013 with my dissertation, or maybe a little earlier in a few mucky conference papers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Misinformation</h2>
<p>In my opinion, I pissed off some of both the XR research and XR industry stakeholders. And I got two rebuttals. The most attention and chuckling came from me doing a TLDR on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">myth section</a> and just coming out and saying</p>
<blockquote>Virtual Reality Causes Faster Learning - Myth</blockquote>
<p>That was surprising-- mostly because I don't expect to turn any aircraft carriers with that language. Did I? Time will tell.</p>
<p>Indeed, support for and any engagement with the articles dropped off over time. It was as though literally if one posted ANYTHING with the word Metaverse it in, a whole crowd of whoopdeedooers üéâüòÄü§òüéâ would drop by, hit the clap button üëè, wish you well and...disappear.¬† I mean I felt I wrote some uplifting, helpful, and cheap (for the price) advice in the latter articles and there were...crickets.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Coda</h2>
<p>There is too much XR-for-education misinformation going on out there for me to remain quiet on some of this shit.</p>
<p>Just this morning, I woke up to find fresh serving in my LinkedIn feed.¬† It's like I want to take a break from writing but the crap keeps flowing in the door.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/732/crap-Instructional-Design-in-the-Metaverse-BTS.png" alt="Screen capture of &quot;report&quot; text: The numbers show that virtual reality in the workplace can improve communication, togetherness, output satisfaction, and the experience of working together in virtual workshops." width="772" height="117" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/732/responsive/crap-Instructional-Design-in-the-Metaverse-BTS-xs.png 640w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/732/responsive/crap-Instructional-Design-in-the-Metaverse-BTS-sm.png 768w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/732/responsive/crap-Instructional-Design-in-the-Metaverse-BTS-md.png 1024w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/732/responsive/crap-Instructional-Design-in-the-Metaverse-BTS-lg.png 1366w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/732/responsive/crap-Instructional-Design-in-the-Metaverse-BTS-xl.png 1600w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/732/responsive/crap-Instructional-Design-in-the-Metaverse-BTS-2xl.png 1920w"></figure>
<p>In one sentence, nearly every good research rule was broken:</p>
<blockquote>The numbers show that virtual reality in the workplace can improve communication, togetherness, output satisfaction, and the experience of working together in virtual workshops.</blockquote>
<p>"The numbers show" - that's an appeal to research results.¬† What they mean is THEIR numbers from THEIR study which was not really structured as research at all. It was structured as a rah-rah-sis-boom-bah don't-we-love-the-newest-shiniest-thing data collection exercise.</p>
<p>"Improve communication" - how? how measured?</p>
<p>Improve [implied] togetherness - how measured?<br><br>Improve [implied] output satisfaction - that is a "like" study, which means nothing to productivity. Tricky there....using "output" to make you think these might be widgets. Nope.</p>
<p>Improve [implied] the experience of working together in virtual workshops.¬† You know what ALSO improves the experience of working together in virtual workshops? Free food.</p>
<p>All that implication was a bit of a grammatical somersault but alas, it is what it is.¬†</p>
<p>Hopefully if you understood my point, you'd see that these "numbers" refer to novelty effect.¬† Pretty much on the nail head.¬† People had fun because it was new. It won't always be new, so be careful.¬†</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">AI</h2>
<p>Because I wrote and published this article series in 2023, a valid question must be asked:¬†</p>
<p>Did I use AI at all in the writing of this?<br>Answer: <strong>Yes. And I'll tell you exactly where.</strong></p>
<p>When I was proofreading myself (so long after finishing writing), I wanted to check on a somewhat novel phrase that I was using (coining?) just to make sure that my intended meaning matched what others might think it means.</p>
<p>I asked Bing to clarify the difference between these 2 phrases:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Non-cognitively comparable methods</li>
<li>Non-comparable cognitive methods</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sure enough, Bing helped clarify that the 'non-' in front is the item negated. That is:<br>Non-cognitively comparable means that something <strong><i>is</i></strong> comparable but the DIFFERENCE is in the cognition. That's exactly what I meant; <strong><i>the brain burden is different.¬†</i> </strong>This occurs when studies try to compare textbook learning to VR learning. It's non-cognitively comparable. Therefore, null results.<strong><i> </i></strong>It's like dividing by zero.<strong><i><br></i></strong></p>
<p>Non-comparable cognitive methods assumes that both methods are cognitive (yeah, duh) but that they are not comparable. No, that's NOT what I meant. People try comparing like crazy, even if I don't like it.</p>
<p>So I stuck with my original writing and phrase: non-cognitively comparable.</p>
<p>And that's the only AI I knowingly used. It's possible that Google Scholar had some AI with reference writing?? But I don't know that. That's sort of pre-AI because really a reference is just an act of putting the right thing in the right place with the right formatting. It can be driven by code...not by some sort of intelligence.</p>
<p>I did use Midjourney to make the artwork but that was completely separate from the writing (and was really fun and educational!)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, in over 12,000 words, is there anything more I can say that I didn't cover?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that my freely given advice is not lost on decision makers. I constantly write <i>for</i> someone with her hands on a multi-thousands or multi-millions of dollars budget and she needs to KNOW WHAT TO DECIDE when she gets an XR or virtual reality for education proposal on her desk.</p>
<p>I wrote all of this with NO tie to money whatsoever. I'm not employed. I do not work for a company that will sell you XR.¬† I'm not working as an instructional designer pushing XR choices on my bosses.¬† LinkedIn articles, unlike Medium articles, provide NO pay-per-click (although, to be fair Medium pays less than pennies per click..so comparing pennies to nothing is a bit of a low blow). I do not have a monetized YouTube account. I don't have anything social media wise that makes me money.¬† I'm "employed" at my own Consulting business but that is just a front to make me "look" employed to LinkedIn. I've done no work for pay in 2023. Actually, during the writing and publication, I don't own a car so I used the public bus and I utilized the provisions of a food pantry.¬†¬†</p>
<p>I have nothing at stake to sway a person one way or another. I'm simply calling out where the research points. I do hope it will be of value to someone.</p>
<p>Here's my LinkedIn video summary of the 8 articles. In under 3 minutes, you can get it all! The bad news? It will come at you VERY fast.¬†</p>

<p>We've arrived at Part 8 of this series which proposes instructional design principles for the metaverse. It's the season finale!</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">First, no researcher worth their salt would give so much advice without acknowledging where the whole thing falls apart-- known as the "Limitations" section of writing.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Second, my absolutely favorite, top, best, most loved tip of all is here. Thesaurus dot com tells me that another word for it "happenstance"-- which is a word I do use. Alas, serendipity sounds more eloquent.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Finally, the conclusion. We're at the bottom of the ski jump; it's moments before I launch you out. What have you learned? Have you learned how to read research? Have you learned what makes a design strong? Have you learned that the <i>media of the metaverse</i> is minor but it is the emotion that makes it work?</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Reach out with your feelings, Luke.</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading">Limitations</h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">What are the weaknesses in applying what we already know about 2D ID to 3D environments? Learner-centric design uses the dual channel coding theory as a basis. That theory restricts information input to the two sense channels: sight and sound. This served instructional design well when education was face-to-face or e-learning. XR, however, can add other senses, haptics, smell, and taste. The input of learning information via other senses is largely unexplored territory.</p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/733/Mayer-modified.png" alt="Edited capture of Mayer's Dual Channel hypothesis diagram with added text: What about our smell, taste, touch, and body position senses? How will XR use these senses for learning? The research does not say...yet." width="2240" height="1260" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/733/responsive/Mayer-modified-xs.png 640w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/733/responsive/Mayer-modified-sm.png 768w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/733/responsive/Mayer-modified-md.png 1024w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/733/responsive/Mayer-modified-lg.png 1366w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/733/responsive/Mayer-modified-xl.png 1600w ,https://hobbs-hobbler.github.io/hobbs.blog/media/posts/733/responsive/Mayer-modified-2xl.png 1920w">
<figcaption >If we should reduce cognitive workload from text and sound conflicts, how will smell, taste, touch, and proprioception intersect with learning?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For example, haptic and temperature feedback are currently added to XR firefighter training. The limitation in the hypothesis of this article series could be that it fails to acknowledge what role these other senses will play in the future. In short, it is possible that the dual channel coding assumption might need to be expanded in the future to engage more channels.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Further, it is very difficult to predict an entire design plan from just one viewpoint. For example, using narrative plot sounds like an excellent approach, but it would fall flat during direct instructional approaches because the learner does not drive that approach.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This series advocated for purpose and emotion within 3D design but those approaches are not meant to be used only at the planning and designing stages. There should be an ebb and flow between the instructional designer (ID) and all stakeholders, testing and re-asking what the XR space is designed to do. <strong>Applications beyond what have been already researched or envisioned will surely test this article series' reasoning in new dimensions.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Finally, it should also be acknowledged that an article series on the use of the XR in ID does not intend to malign or downgrade other media for learning. Instead, the purpose of this series is to provide early guidance in a developing area. Slowly the research field gathers information that the next generation of IDs can use.</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading">Serendipity</h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Sometimes, something magical happens that even the instructional designer (ID) did not imagine. These moments can be the most endearing and creative for learners. These serendipitous moments often happen far beyond the bounds of the design and programming. For example, in Poland, teachers who had never used VR before received 30 minutes of training before entering the game Half-Life: Alyx to teach language, math, and science (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/teachers-poland-half-life-alyx-vr/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bretan</a>, 2020).</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Learners discover how to fall through ramps and piggy-back on other avatars when playing with surface and wall programming. Spontaneous games break out like follow-the-leader. Learners have walked into the middle of roaring virtual campfires - just to see what it was like. An XR volcano scene spontaneously created a Star Wars story.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Human behavior in practical applications escapes around theories like water around a dam.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="article-editor-content__blockquote">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This makes educational research different from controlled laboratory studies; while we hope for what is predicted, <strong><i>humans can delightfully exceed their programming. </i></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The combination of curiosity, exploration, and bravery cannot always be planned for in a learning design. It should not be squashed.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Therefore, <strong>leave space in designs for the unexpected;</strong> do not plan every moment.</p>
<blockquote class="article-editor-content__blockquote">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Leave space for serendipity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This can look like leaving time for learners to get used to their avatars, let them practice grabbing and tossing 3D objects, and let them use spaces in unexpected ways. Have warm-up type of events before more formal learning events. Let learners explore freely through a space before calling them back for a learning event.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In <strong><i>these</i></strong> moments, <strong>learners</strong> can show <strong>IDs</strong> what XR can <i>really</i> do.</p>
<h2 class="article-editor-content__heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">To conclude, this series covered the frequently cited research myths surrounding the use of XR in education. It also brought to the forefront the three characteristics to look for when evaluating possible XR solutions: Does it reduce time, money, or danger? It went through the principles of multimedia design to show how they would apply to 3D designs‚Äìseparating out what affordances would behave the same (paying close attention to cognitive processing) and what affordances would be different (realizing that 3D basically means more everything- more visuals, more sound, more motion, and emotion- around a learner). It contained some design advice that needs to be remembered when dealing with the metaverse; focus on purpose, design for emotion, and remember real world correlations.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">From this, it might be valid to infer that this article series portrayed research myths at the periphery of publishing while creating a pessimistic view of the possibilities of XR - the proverbial cold bucket of water thrown on the excitement for the metaverse. Indeed, <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://edtechbooks.org/foundations_of_learn/also_32_media_method/simple" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honebein and Reigeluth</a> did not mince words when they advised that IDs:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">"<strong>Be cautious </strong>of experimental, research-to-prove comparison studies that include media or combine media and instructional methods. In other words, buyer beware. This research is not useful because it might:</p>
<ul class="article-editor-content__bullet-list">
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Suggest that learning effectiveness is improved by the media, when in fact it is improved by the instructional method.</p>
</li>
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Influence practitioners to choose media that likely won‚Äôt work for their situation.</p>
</li>
<li class="article-editor-content__list-item">
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Represent quick and dirty publications that are intentionally or unintendedly meant to pad a researcher‚Äôs portfolio for promotion, salary increase, and tenure. <strong>In other words, the paper benefits the author, not the reader.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">When designing a learning experience, follow the processes associated with the theoretical framework" (2023, p. 13, added emphasis mine).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">IDs will need to stand up and state that some uses of the metaverse are not recommended. IDs will be required to closely examine research. The best uses of XR technologies will be when XR reduces or manipulates time, saves money, or reduces danger. Technologies such as simulations or branding scenarios already compete closely on those three characteristics. Designs should be approached in a learner-centric manner, using design techniques such as narrative plot or the XR strengths in visuals, sound, and interaction. Designs should lean towards the conservative.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This vista ahead, however, is bright. There is enticing area that we‚Äôve not yet traveled into fully: the fully nuanced role of emotion in learning as that intersects with the metaverse. Mayer ended his tome on multimedia learning in 2020 acknowledging that while seductive details are irrelevant to learning, designing <strong><i>emotion</i></strong> <strong>purposely into learning</strong> seems to intersect with self-efficacy‚Äì a factor known to create motivation for learning. To be clear, this means designing in non-player characters (NPCs) or scenarios where emotion is purposely present.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Mayer is not the only major researcher starting to look towards emotion. Honebein and Reigeluth posited that appeal is part of the Instructional Design Iron Triangle, with effectiveness and efficiency. Appeal makes learning recommendable or to use another phrase, creates repeat customers (2023, p. 7). This author herself hears directly from many educators that observe that learners are drawn to this medium in ways not seen before, with the common trait being <i>the social aspect</i> of being able<strong> to feel</strong> <i>together</i>: a shared feeling and communication. The users that exit XR the fastest seem to be those that never interact with another person in an XR space. What's happening there will have to wait for the next Pasteur‚Äôs Quadrant article.¬†</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">The possible uses of the metaverse in education are diverse, creative, and beautiful that to commodify it would be to harm it. Instructional designers should open their imaginations to see new vistas, thinking of the Metaverse‚Äôs <i>best</i> uses, equipped with what we already know to meet the new challenges in learning.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">May the Blessing of the Metaverse be with you.</p>
