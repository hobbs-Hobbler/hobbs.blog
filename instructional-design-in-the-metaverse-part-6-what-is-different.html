<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">A learner could learn from a book how to enter a store and buy something. A learner could also learn from entering a real store and buying something. Both are ways to complete the learning, but the designs– that is, how to structure the learning from start to finish, will be different. The book is analogous to direct instruction. There are times when direct instruction will be the better approach. The real store is analogous to experiential learning. There are times when experiential learning will be the better approach. The approaches are different; there is no inherently better approach for all situations.  </p>

Learners engage in making meaningful connections when words and pictures align during experiences. Meaning is also deeply embedded in the storytelling approach, where it is often the journey that the protagonist goes through that remains memorable long after a story has ended. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PXRJEAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=UpbIsA4SJU&amp;dq=learning%20experience%20design%20Clark&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">D. Clark</a> argued, “learning experiences are exactly that, experiences designed to change us, specifically our long term memories” (2022, p. 7). Further, D. Clark advocated for a balanced use of storytelling, explaining that it can bring life to dry information, but should not be overused and wander into a “Disneyfication of learning as entertainment” (2022, p. 7). Lastly, D. Clark argued that stories for learning should be designed as “always beginnings, never ends-in-themselves” if the learning is to be applicable beyond the experience, into the “long tail of practice, transfer, and performance” (2022, p. 7).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Points for poetry, D. Clark! </p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Indeed, the storytelling approach in learning pulls the learner through the experience. To use storytelling, the learner should experience a flow through their experience, a beginning and middle of the story. The end could happen in XR or more substantially outside of XR into desired application. The learning experience <strong>should be planned and not haphazard.</strong> Learners should be guided on a planned route. XR storytelling can be first person or group experiences. Regardless, each learner is a protagonist; their decisions determine what they will experience. Recalling the constructivist learning theory foundation, what the learners <i>experience</i> becomes the learning experience that is being designed <i>for</i>. If learners are exposed to situations where they actively construct their knowledge, then the reality that the learners construct was constructed <i>by them</i>, not constructed by the media or by others. Further, learners do not arrive as empty vessels to be passively filled with information if they are the protagonists of their own learning event. Learners add, sort, emphasize, or suppress new experiences when compared to old experiences.  Subsequently, a learner already experienced in real life (non-XR) is bringing those experiences into XR with them. In summary, <strong>learners arrive already ready to experience a story. Thus, narrative plot or a story arc is a good approach to XR instructional design.</strong></p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Plot, narrative, or narrative plot are all descriptions of phases within storytelling. There are slight variances in names but the phases generally focus on the user’s (or in our case, the learner’s) experience (<a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DHo3DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=mZnAwii8NJ&amp;dq=Lichaw%2C%20D.%20(2016).%20The%20user's%20journey%3A%20Storymapping%20projects%20that%20people%20love.%20New%20York%3A%20Rosenfeld%20Media&amp;lr&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lichaw</a>, 2016). </p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">These phases describe what is happening to the protagonist. In the case of XR, the learner is the star and they should be brought through these phases in an effective design plan. Table 1 compares a storytelling arc with the Pixar story arc, a story arc example of Cinderella, an XR story arc, and an XR narrative plot example. </p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">Example of Narrative Plot in XR</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Introduction.</strong> The who, what, where, why, when of the experience is explained. The scene opens. This starts before the digital experience begins and lasts 30 seconds to a few minutes into the experience, depending on how much needs to be explained. This is the beginning of the exposition.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Set the scene. </strong>Provide guidance on the affordances within the experience, how to communicate, walk, navigate, where is help (e.g. where is a digital companion). The learner is invited to move, change appearance, and communicate.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Dilemma.</strong> Introduce the conflict or the scenario that the learner will participate in. The learner is presented with a challenge or problem. This is the inciting incident and rising action phases. This can be a great time to guide and practice small solutions to small problems.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Crisis.</strong> The learner must act and initiate some sort of change. It is action-oriented, and the learner is on center stage.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Change or Denouement.</strong> The results of the change have an impact on consequences or the environment. Said another way, the change ripples through the experience to change it for the learner. The results are non-trivial and not haphazard.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>Resolution or End.</strong> The mission is complete, and the world has changed around the learner. The learner is living out the consequences of their decision.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Some research has shown that most of the instructional emphasis does not need to be within the XR experience itself. <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/l3tw6O8Hn-s?feature=share&amp;t=1663" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dede</a> (2021), when reflecting on what he now believes after over five decades of immersive learning research, said:</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">“I used to believe that if you had resources, you should spend 95% of the resources on the immersive experience and then you just do a little thinking about what kind of induction you use before people go into immersion and what kind of post experience debriefing you do.  I’ve come to believe now that the induction and debriefing is where the learning takes place predominantly, and so designing those is very important.”</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This indicates the importance of the on-boarding and the follow up experiences. The story of an experience begins before something is activated and ends long after.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><strong>The main point of keeping a narrative plot mindset in ID XR design is to keep the learner at the center of the experience. </strong>Every step of the narrative plot approach focuses on what the protagonist- that is, the learner- experiences: dilemmas, crisis, change, etc. This approach, then, keeps the ID focused on the learner’s experience, not the technology. For example, let’s say a platform can recreate the school environment down to the desks and chairs. An ID might reason, ‘This a great place to hold a class! I can assign classes to virtual rooms and the instructor can use web-sharing boards.’ </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZXncQoR6J1Wug8PH_6xKWKZyZ772q3k-w61ChXyhfwngenGGeu2UOf84fgF22mDaQ60YKCspz5N6SJFxJw39YPoKI7ZTg799qmVTW_CE1bl9bnrfgJbl8B-ztIKbX-wPeo_Ev640ahyphenhyphen0Gw0bTa0Q046FAS2sCALYMk4pP7aC7d1C-nTrmXuYGxjphUxM/w640-h354/virtual%20reality%20classroom.png" alt="Capture of a classroom in virtual reality, complete with desks, chairs, and chalkboard." width="640" height="354" border="0" data-original-height="757" data-original-width="1366" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>Don't try this in VR</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">That approach puts the technology first and does not consider the learner. It also recreates the problems of regular in-person classrooms and throws in a few more virtual problems as well (i.e., poor internet connections might have avatars distractedly appearing and disappearing). Rather, a learner-centric approach might ask “What is the main experience or emotion that the instructor wants the learners to have in this lesson?” As <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/multimedia-learning/FB7E79A165D24D47CEACEB4D2C426ECD#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayer</a> stated, “How can we adapt multimedia technology to <i>aid </i>human cognition?” (2020, p. 15). This might cause the ID to look at the entire XR event differently and not recommend a virtual classroom. There is more on emotion in design in Section 5.2.</p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2 Visual and Sound Range</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">For the ID, the added visual depth and sound possibilities beyond 2D must be designed. However, more to design means more risk. With XR, the added ability to put information anywhere has more risk of overwhelming the learner than helping the learner. Indeed, D. Clark (2022) agrees that Mayer’s Principles lean towards <strong>less is more</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.1 Visuals</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph"><a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://aperturesciencellc.com/vr/VisualDesignMethodsforVR_MikeAlger.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alger</a> (2015) noted these basic principles for visual range called the Comfortable Content Zone: 77 degrees of viewing range side to side and a range of 0.5 to 20 meters in depth. There are Periphery Zones to the sides and above, but the learner should be only prompted to use those. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXlCGMsk_cHdRuq4D9ZKPbgl5DEVXSMv7cehq-y8HfE0xdTrI4nTFh6UZ9SNg4ezMLhusTnsIhuYbZJWTd8uX83DNW85bMlvIrg2MoAab5xZ-AVmROSTnq02oTfoPBjUPYq3yCMwa0ACm2okNvey03RPUSUKc4AUpxgGMf03JOzoqnZ61vKFdbpUmQJXo/w640-h328/Mike%20Alger%202.png" alt="Diagram showing that main content should be placed between 0.5m and 20m to the front of the user. The sides are the peripheral zone and the back/behind is the curiosity zone.

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">This reflects real life. If one was working at a workstation, critical information would be within easy viewing and reach. Other information could be available in what Alger calls the Curiosity Zone – behind and below the learner, but learners should be prompted, as in real life, by sound, light, or foreknowledge, to engage with that non-obvious space (2015).</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Alger (2015) further proposes that the visual hierarchy matches the importance of information. To find information in 3D, we look at the center ahead first, then left and right, then below, then above, then finally at our own bodies. Everything above eye level is for things beyond the learner’s control like weather, time, or authority notifications. Everything at or below eye level is within the learner’s control.</p>

</figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">These user interface principles skew towards conservatism in detail; less is better. IDs should design minimal spaces, with prompts, and within easy arm reach. IDs can create storyboards with isomorphic qualities that both curve around the learner and contain planning space for the foreground, mid-ground, and background visuals.</p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.2 Sound</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Immersive sound is a rising field within XR design. Poor sound can ruin an XR experience. Experiences can have <strong>spatial sound</strong> where the loudness drops off over virtual distance or <strong>flat sound</strong> where the loudness is the same throughout the entire space. As much as possible, it is good accessible practice that <strong>all senses should have learner controls</strong>: brightness, sound, movement, and intensity. </p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">After Cosmonious High from Owlchemy Labs did some vision updates, they had over 1.53 million times users put their hand over an object to request text-to-speech--in one month and only with Quest users. Still think accessibility features are optional?</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Many platforms and experiences already contain volume controls for separate parts of the experience (e.g., voice chat, environment, or notifications all have separate volume controls). Learners should be trained on these controls at on-boarding.</p>

<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.3 Interaction &amp; Movement</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Interactions in XR could be reaching, grabbing, and moving. Good experimental research exists from organizations like <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://ieeevr.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEEE VR</a> or <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://iui.acm.org/2024/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACM IUI</a> on 3D user interface recommendations. Alger’s (2015) design advice showed a seated avatar seated work will be more comfortable than standing in XR.</p>

<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Almost every new XR user has walked their avatar into a wall. It happens. </p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP-w38jE54vtgDNf5mkFrPrh32EnjmGyyInAPf4oD83J0Y1K7nTaQLpBLErGZtE78uA72g-pD1zvrs8arJZXeiPTmeHavuEOH8g2VXwfNpNqeH9-WvUzjW9FkS7M2VTq1fVsMICpKAK7rqqGSU3fmGlvzrfi3wTRO_SWIwo0r6BpooU6zI8Pckc1mHVa8/w400-h308/Peter%20must%20stand%20in%20the%20corner%20after%20the%20Workshop%20meeting.png" alt="Capture of my friend Peter when he walked his avatar into a corner." width="400" height="308" border="0" data-original-height="726" data-original-width="946" data-is-external-image="true"><figcaption>You stay in that corner until you can act like a good avatar, Peter!</figcaption></figure>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Given that the wall isn’t real, mistakes like this are forgiven quickly. IDs can ask learners to move. </p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">(And Peter knew I took his picture at this moment above.)</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Movement in XR is an advantage of the metaverse. While research does not indicate that movement causes learning, it can greatly assist in the storytelling aspect of bringing a learner through an experience by requesting that the avatar move <i>through the story</i> in virtual space time.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Movement is <i>relative</i> in this media. Frame of reference can be manipulated. The avatar can move, or the avatar can stay in one place and the scenes can move or change around them. There are a LOT of <a class="article-editor-content__link article-editor-content__link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/807-virtual-reality-games-locomotion-methods.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">choices for movement in XR</a>. From gaming research, it looks like most of the possibilities are aiming to reduce vestibular mismatch.</p>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">In this area, movement-based engagement can be an area of exploration in designs. For example, asking learners to move to one side of the room or another is an interesting way to run a poll. XR movement often includes dancing and flying. Future research should explore the use of controllers or hand detection for learning.</p>
<h3 class="article-editor-content__heading">2.4 Emojis</h3>
<p class="article-editor-content__paragraph">Many social XR platforms have incorporated emojis and they can be used for their apparent reasons: love, happy, sad, clapping, or raised hand. Within designs, learners can use them differently, that is for feedback, poll indicators, or silent ‘I need help’ indicators. Learners have been known to redefine emojis to mean whatever makes sense to them during a learning event.</p>
